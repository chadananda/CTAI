  "translation": "Praise be to God, the Eternal that perisheth not, the Everlasting that declineth not, the Self-Subsisting that altereth not. He it is Who is transcendent in His sovereignty, Who is manifest through His signs, and is hidden through His mysteries. He it is at Whose bidding the standard of the Most Exalted Word hath been lifted up in the world of creation, and the banner of \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\" raised amidst all peoples. He it is Who hath revealed His Cause for the guidance of His creatures, and sent down His verses to demonstrate His Proof and His Testimony, and embellished the preface of the Book of Man with the ornament of utterance through His saying: \"The God of Mercy hath taught the Qur’án, hath created man, and taught him articulate speech.\" No God is there but Him, the One, the Peerless, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beneficent.",
