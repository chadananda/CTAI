      There's a reason for that. Translation of sacred text isn't a solo sport.

  <!-- ===== SHOGHI EFFENDI'S STANDARD ===== -->
  <section class="max-w-3xl mx-auto pb-20">
    <div class="bg-white rounded-xl border border-stone-200 p-8 md:p-12 shadow-sm">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-6">
        Then Shoghi Effendi raised the bar.
      </h2>
      <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For over thirty years, the Guardian of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith translated
        Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h's Arabic and Persian into some of the most architecturally
        coherent English prose of the twentieth century. He didn't just translate words.
        He built a <em>system</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Take the Arabic <span class="font-arabic text-lg" dir="rtl">قَلْبًا جَيِّدًا حَسَنًا مُنيرًا</span>.
        Literally: &ldquo;a good, beautiful, luminous heart.&rdquo; Three physical adjectives.
        Shoghi Effendi renders this as <strong>&ldquo;a pure, kindly and radiant heart&rdquo;</strong>
        &mdash; three <em>spiritual</em> qualities. Same structure, entirely different register.
        His widow R&uacute;h&iacute;yyih Kh&aacute;num explained why: he believed
        &ldquo;Arabic synonyms usually meant the same thing but English ones always had
        a slight shade of difference which made it possible to be more exact
        in rendering the thought.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Or consider <span class="font-arabic text-lg" dir="rtl">تقلید</span> (<em>Taql&iacute;d</em>).
        A dictionary says &ldquo;imitation.&rdquo; But in Islamic jurisprudence
        <em>Taql&iacute;d</em> carries a deeply negative connotation &mdash;
        the uncritical acceptance of authority without independent investigation.
        So Shoghi Effendi rendered it <strong>&ldquo;blind imitation&rdquo;</strong> &mdash;
        adding an adjective that isn't in the Arabic <em>because the Arabic already implies it</em>
        to any educated reader.
      </p>
      <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        He did this across tens of thousands of phrases. The word
        <span class="font-arabic" dir="rtl">مطلع</span> (<em>Ma&thorn;li'</em>)
        is consistently rendered with solar imagery &mdash; &ldquo;Dayspring,&rdquo; &ldquo;Day Star,&rdquo;
        &ldquo;Dawning-place&rdquo; &mdash; preserving the cosmological metaphor that pervades
        the original. The word
        <span class="font-arabic" dir="rtl">مُلْك</span> (<em>Mulk</em>)
        is always &ldquo;sovereignty,&rdquo; never &ldquo;kingdom,&rdquo; never &ldquo;dominion.&rdquo;
        Every choice reinforces every other choice, creating a terminology so coherent
        that a single English word can unlock an entire Arabic concept.
      </p>
      <p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        Franklin Lewis, the University of Chicago Persian scholar, put it beautifully:
        Shoghi Effendi's approach was <em>&ldquo;artistic rather than strictly doctrinal&rdquo;</em>
        &mdash; aimed at recreating &ldquo;the psychological and spiritual experience of
        reading the original.&rdquo; Like a musical conductor, he chose the tempo, the attack,
        the mode of expression &mdash; and
        <strong>&ldquo;has not played a single wrong note.&rdquo;</strong>

        in their efforts to approach what must always be regarded as the unattainable
        goal &mdash; a befitting rendering of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h's matchless utterance.&rdquo;

        Even the authorized translator &mdash; the one whose renderings are the institutional
        standard for all subsequent translations into other languages &mdash;
        saw perfect translation as something to be <em>approached</em>, never reached.
      </p>
      <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And he didn't approach it alone. He consulted George Townshend, an Irish
        cleric and literary master, on nearly every major translation from the
        Hidden Words through <em>God Passes By</em>. Ethel Rosenberg reviewed the
        Hidden Words word-by-word. Esslemont assisted. Their combined effect,
        Townshend's biographers note, elevated the translations
        <strong class="text-white">&ldquo;from being very good to being exquisite.&rdquo;</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="text-stone-300 leading-relaxed">
        He wrote every sentence aloud. He kept a 1934 Webster's Dictionary at hand.
        He read Gibbon and Carlyle for their prose rhythms.
        He revised the Hidden Words <em>four times</em> &mdash;
        1924, 1925, 1929, and 1954. The result was, as scholars describe it,
        &ldquo;a grand synthesis of English majestic writing &mdash;
        Jacobean, Restoration, Victorian, and Edwardian &mdash;
        blended seamlessly into a new literary creation.&rdquo;
