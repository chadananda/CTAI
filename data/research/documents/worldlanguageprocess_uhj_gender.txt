## Use of Masculine
Pronouns and Images

 

The
Research Department has studied the questions on the above-mentioned subject

raised by Mrs. Nancy Branham
Songer in her emailed letter dated 22 June 2002 to the

Universal House of Justice.
Mrs. Songer observes that in the authorized English translations

of the Bah�� Scriptures and
in the English writings of the Guardian, God is invariably termed

�Father�, masculine pronouns
are used in reference to the Divinity, and the term �man� is used to represent
humanity as well as individuals. From her study of the Bah�� teachings Mrs.
Songer is aware that �this usage is a product of convention and the images are
generic and intended to be inclusive�. She is also cognizant of the fact that
�these practices nevertheless raise certain questions because of the importance
of language in the formation of worldview�. In this regard she states that
�according to [her] understanding, two important spiritual features of this age
will be the deanthropomorphization of God in the minds of human beings and the
equality of the sexes�. However, it is her view that the present �language of
the Bah�� scriptures � can be seen to repeat and reinforce the sense that the
Divine is somehow male�, and the �consistent use of �man� and masculine
pronouns in the Writings to represent humanity and individuals contributes to
an image that the human archetype is male�. In light of these observations,
Mrs. Songer poses a number of detailed questions concerning the work of
translation�the implications of present practice for future translations,
whether �Bah�� English with regard to gender was crystallized at the point of
the Guardian�s translations�, whether the universal auxiliary language will
need �to retain masculine imagery in order to be true to the message or will it
be able to establish new forms�, and whether �there are spiritual implications
to sex-specific imagery � being fixed in holy Scriptures for all time or at
least until the end of this dispensation�. We provide the following comment.

 

By
way of introduction, we wish to note that the Research Department has not, to

date, been able to locate
detailed guidance concerning the specific technical issues raised by

Mrs. Songer about the
practical implications of present translation practices for the future work of
translation, especially as they relate to gender issues. To assist Mrs. Songer
in thinking about the questions she poses, we attach the following four
compilations:

 

q       �The Use of the Masculine
Gender in the Bah�� Writings�, a compilation of extracts from letters written
by and on behalf of the Universal House of Justice. The extracts in the
compilation set out a number of general principles in relation to this subject
and the Bah�� perspective on it. We note, for example, the House of Justice
indicates that:

�      
�In
many languages the use of the masculine gender, unless intended specifically
todenote masculinity, is generic� (extract 1, see also extracts 2 and 6).

�      
�The
translation of the Writings of the Central Figures of the Faith must of
necessityagree in full detail with the original in conveying the exact meaning
of the Words as

they have been revealed�
(extracts 2, 8 and 9). In addition, the Universal House of

Justice indicates that it
�does not feel it appropriate to change Shoghi Effendi�s usage of

certain nouns in his
translations� (extract 8). Indeed, �The style of translation into

English was set by Shoghi
Effendi� (extract 10).

 

 �� the Sacred Writings of the Faith and
     those of the Guardian do not use the �gender inclusive language� now in
     vogue�� (extract 7).

 

 In relation to images of God, while
     using �conventional wording� Bah�u�ll�h �devoted vast numbers of Tablets
     to conveying the truth that God is not only neither male nor female, but
     is far above all human understanding� (extracts 8 and 10).

 

 With regard to the English language,
     �the issue of gender-specific nouns may be

resolved either by changing
the usage of nouns, or by permitting the consciousness of

sexual equality to modify
the meaning of nouns as they are now used. No doubt both

courses will be followed in
the evolution of the language. It is generally considered

preferable to permit the
change of consciousness to change the meaning that people

attribute to words, rather
than to press the use of forms of words, which may seem

contrived� (extract 8).

 

�        
�The
challenge � is to accept the use of pronouns in their generic sense, which will

lead one to view the matter
in terms of a spiritual response, rather than one of

semantics� (extracts 8 and
10).

 

q       �Literary
Style�Translation�, a compilation of materials that was prepared some time ago.
The compilation includes a statement from �Abdu�l-Bah� about translation,
extracts from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi and the Universal
House of Justice, and a description of the writings of Shoghi Effendi excerpted
from R�H�yyih Rabbani�s �The Priceless Pearl� (London: Bah�� Publishing Trust,
1969), pages 196�204.

 

q       �The Difficult Art of
Translation�Selected Extracts from Letters Written By and on Behalf of the
Universal House of Justice Concerning the Translations of Shoghi Effendi�.
Extracts in the compilation address such issues as:

 

�       The status of Shoghi
Effendi�s translations (extracts 1 and 6). The importance of his translations
as a starting point for translations into other European languages (extract 1).

 

�       The Guardian�s approach to
translation (extracts 2, 4, and 7).

 

�       The interpretative aspect to
Shoghi Effendi�s translations (extracts 1, 5, and 6).

 

�       Translators are encouraged
to �strive to render the words of the B�b, Bah�u�ll�h and �Abdu�l-Bah� into
English in a way that reproduces as accurately as possible the meaning of the
originals, that is as beautiful as possible, and that harmonizes closely with
the style used by Shoghi Effendi� (extract 4).

 

q       �Importance of and Guidance
on Translating the Bah�� Writings into Indigenous and Other Languages�. This
compilation, consisting mostly of the correspondence of the Universal� House of Justice, was prepared some time ago.
Despite the fact that there is a degree of

repetition in the content,
it is included because of Mrs. Songer�s interest in the importance

and use of language.

As
to Mrs. Songer�s question concerning whether �the universal auxiliary language
needs to retain masculine imagery in order to be true to the message or will it
be able to establish new forms�, the Research Department has not, to date, been
able to locate any references to this subject in the authoritative literature
of the Faith. However, we call attention to the following statement of the
Universal House of Justice in a letter dated 8 December 1964, which is included
in extract 1 of the attached document �The Difficult Art of Translation�:

 

We also feel that it is
still premature to decide upon the question of the International Auxiliary
Language. It is quite clear from the Texts that any living 

or invented language may be
chosen, but the time and manner of its choosing and propagation are not yet
decided.

The Use of the Masculine Gender in the Bah�� Writings

Extracts from Letters Written By and on Behalf of the Universal House
of Justice

 

 

In
many languages the use of the masculine gender, unless intended specifically to
denote

masculinity, is generic. For
instance, in English we speak of the race of man, or mankind, in

both instances meaning every
member of the human race�men, women and children. There

would be no reason to
interpret �O Son of Being�, or �O Son of Man� as addressed only to

males. It is the same with
pronouns.

(5
April 1981, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an

individual
believer) [1]

 

The
principle of the equality of men and women which is firmly established by the

Author of the Faith and
forms one of the basic tenets of our belief will be fully realized as the

human race matures in its
understanding of the significance of Bah�u�ll�h�s Revelation.

Equality will be achieved as
a direct result of the adjustments the friends are required to make

in their attitude towards
this fundamental issue so essential to the establishment of the unity of

mankind, and despite the
exigencies of the languages in which the revealed Words have been

received and in which they
have been translated. �Abdu�l-Bah� says: �...in His estimate there is

no question of sex.� �In the
estimation of God there is no gender.�1�

 

The
translation of the Writings of the Central Figures of the Faith must of
necessity agree

in full detail with the
original in conveying the exact meaning of the Words as they have been

revealed. The Guardian did
not even approve the changing of pronouns in Bah�� prayers when

they are read. Therefore, no
deviation in translation from the actual meaning of the words, to

accommodate the general
trend of thought and behaviour affecting a language, is conceivable,

unless, of course, the
equivalent of the original word does not exist in a given language. In one

of His talks quoted in �The
Promulgation of Universal Peace�, page 76, �Abdu�l-Bah� says:

 

The
truth is that all mankind are the creatures and servants of one God, and in His

estimate
all are human. �Man� is a generic term applying to all humanity. The biblical

statement
�Let us make man in our image, after our likeness� does not mean that woman

was
not created. The image and likeness of God apply to her as well. In Persian and

Arabic
there are two distinct words translated into English as man: one meaning man
and

woman
collectively, the other distinguishing man as male from woman the female. The

first
word and its pronoun are generic, collective; the other is restricted to the
male. This

is
the same in Hebrew.

 

Concerning
the English language, it is interesting that the 1983 edition of the Concise

Oxford English Dictionary
gives �human being� as the first meaning of �man�; and only as the

fourth meaning �adult human
male, opp. to woman, boy, or both.� Therefore, the use of �man�

or �men� in translating the
intent of the Revealer of the Words to embrace all humankind seems

a good choice.

individual

The Use of the Masculine
Gender in the Bah�� Writings �������� ����������� ����������� 25
July 2002

Page 2

 

We
have considered your memorandum of 6 June 1989 and appreciate the points you

have raised concerning the sensitivity
of women, both Bah�� and non-Bah��, to the use of

what are construed to be
exclusively masculine words in the Sacred Writings of the Bah��

Faith.

 

While
we recognize that the problem of gender in language presents difficulties at
the

present time, we must also
recognize that the problem varies considerably from language to

language, depending on the
number of grammatical genders that each language uses.

 

Since
the immediate concern in the translations � centres on usage in English, we
shall

concentrate on the problem
as it exists in that language. English is fortunate in having a

common gender. The problem
of gender-specific nouns is, therefore, susceptible of two lines of

solution. One is to change
the usage of nouns, the other is to permit the consciousness of

sexual equality to modify
the meaning of nouns as now used. Undoubtedly both courses will be

followed in the evolution of
the language. The word �doctor� for example, is now clearly of

common gender in English,
although originally masculine. Our feeling is that, in general, it is

preferable to permit the
change of consciousness to change the meaning that people attribute to

the words, rather than to
press the use of forms of words that seem contrived and, to many

people, ridiculous�a reaction
that does not help the advancement of the cause of the equality

of the sexes. Following this
reasoning, as you will have noted, we used the word �chairman� in

relation to the sessions of
the International Convention, although all were women.

 

In
respect to the Sacred Writings, the originals, clearly, cannot be changed, and
we do not

feel at liberty to change
Shoghi Effendi�s usage of �man� or �mankind� to �humanity� or

�humankind�.

(27
November 1989, from a memorandum from the Universal House of Justice

to
a Bah�� Office of Public Information) [3]

 

There
are, as you indicate, many conventions of expression in use at the present time

which reflect the male
dominance of human society in the past. We must hope that as the

consciousness of human
beings changes and as the equality of the sexes comes to be accepted

in theory and in practice
throughout the world, the meanings attached to certain words will

change accordingly, as will
the usage of words. Language is a living thing and changes as the

culture which it reflects
changes�.

 

The
important point here is that one will not persuade people to change their usage
of

language until one has
convinced them of the true understanding of the reality of things; but

when they once understand
the truth, the meaning that they attach to words changes, and thus a

change in usage becomes much
less important, if not irrelevant.

(8
March 1990, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an

individual)
[4]

 

� the House of Justice is
well aware that, at various times, the meaning attached to certain

words becomes influenced by
emotions and can assume overtones which are offensive to some

segments of the population.
In the case of the generic terms in the English translations of the

Bah�� Writings, the
tendency to take such terms as being applicable only to males is a

reflection of the
male-dominated society which has prevailed for so long, and to which there is

 

 

The Use of the Masculine
Gender in the Bah�� Writings �������� ����������� ����������� 25
July 2002

Page 3

 

a reaction from women who
are seeking legitimate recognition and equality. Bah��s can well

sympathize with such
concerns, while pointing out that language is a living thing and that the

intended meaning of the
generic terms will doubtless become more readily apparent as the

influence of the Bah��
commitment to equality of the sexes permeates human society more

fully.

 

It
is understandable that some non-Bah��s are initially disturbed by the use of
those

terms in our Writings which
are associated conventionally with a male orientation. Seekers

after truth should be
assisted to determine the intended meaning of such terms through

reference to the Bah��
Teachings, rather than through assuming that these terms have the

meaning now prevalent in the
world; thus they will find that they should seek that meaning

which is consistent with
equality of men and women, and which also happens to be the primary

meaning associated with
classical usage of the English language to convey spiritual truths. A

similar approach is called
for when a seeker encounters a number of other terms and phrases in

the Writings.

 

Members
of the Bah�� community should not fall unconsciously into the error of

labelling the Bah��
Writings as being �sexist� or �discriminatory�, or of feeling a need to

apologize to non-Bah��s for
the terms used. Such an attitude would be indicative of a lack of

understanding of the Bah��
approach to this issue, and a lack of confidence in the position

adopted by the Faith in
regard to use of generic terms.

(26
September 1993, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a

National
Spiritual Assembly) [5]

 

We
regret the very long delay in responding to your request � for help in locating

something in print regarding
the use of the male pronoun in the Bah�� Writings. In this regard

we are enclosing a copy of
extracts from letters written on behalf of the Universal House of

Justice to individual
believers regarding the use of the masculine gender in the Writings.

Related to this subject is
the reference on page seven in the introduction to �The Kit�b-i-Aqdas�

where it is stated that it
is apparent from the writings of the Guardian that �where Bah�u�ll�h

has given a law as between a
man and a woman, it applies �mutatis mutandis� between a woman

and a man unless the context
makes this impossible�.

(26
June 1994, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an

individual
believer) [6]

 

In
relating the Teachings of the Faith to the discussion of contemporary social
issues,

Bah�� publications are
challenged by the need to adapt editorial policies to the ever-changing

public perceptions of those
issues, without compromising the fundamental Bah�� principles

and concepts involved. The
question of �gender inclusive language� guidelines is a case in

point. The editors of a publication
like the Journal will certainly have acquainted themselves

with the various points of
view on the subject current among the readership which they and

their authors are
addressing, together with prevailing modes of expression. These factors will

exercise an influence on
Bah�� editorial policy, but must do so within the context of the

Teachings.

 

Clearly,
the Scriptures of the Faith, as revealed by the Founders and interpreted by

�Abdu�l-Bah� and the
Guardian, impose their own requirements on Bah�� authors and editors

alike. On the one hand, an
editorial board will quite properly be concerned to take into account

the preferences and
convictions common to the great majority of the intended readers of its

publication. On the other,
Bah�� authors must be left entirely free to discuss the Revelation of

Bah�u�ll�h in its own terms
and language as set out in the Bah�� Scriptures themselves and in

their authorized interpretations,
irrespective of current fashions in academic and other public

discourse. That is to say:
the Sacred Writings of the Faith and those of the Guardian do not use

the �gender inclusive
language� now in vogue, and it would therefore not be appropriate for the

Editorial Board to impose
such current standards on Bah�� authors.

(26
July 1996, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National

Spiritual
Assembly) [7]

 

Your
letter of 19 September 1996 expressing your concern regarding the use of
inclusive

masculine terms in the
Sacred Writings has been received by the Universal House of Justice,

and we have been asked to
reply.

 

The
point you have raised regarding the sensitivity of women, both Bah�� and non-

Bah��, to the use of
masculine nouns and pronouns when referring to God is noted and your

concern appreciated. It is
recognized that the question of gender in language presents

difficulties at this time;
however, it must also be recognized that the problem varies

considerably from language
to language, depending on the number of grammatical genders that

each language uses.

 

English
is fortunate in having a common gender. Therefore, the issue of gender-specific

nouns may be resolved either
by changing the usage of nouns, or by permitting the

consciousness of sexual
equality to modify the meaning of nouns as they are now used. No

doubt both courses will be
followed in the evolution of the language. It is generally considered

preferable to permit the
change of consciousness to change the meaning that people attribute to

words, rather than to press
the use of forms of words, which may seem contrived.

 

Likewise,
when considering the manner in which masculine nouns and pronouns are used

to refer to God, it is
important to bear in mind that when Bah�u�ll�h was revealing His

Scriptures He had to use
language and forms of expression which could be understood by those

whom He was addressing. This
is the case with every Prophet; He is compelled to use old

forms through which He will
raise humanity to a new level of understanding. In Arabic and

Persian, as in English and
most European languages, it has been customary to refer to God as

�Lord� and �Father�, rather
than �Lady� and �Mother�. While using the conventional wording

Bah�u�ll�h approached the
matter on two levels. In relation to God He devoted vast numbers

of Tablets to conveying the
truth that God is not only neither male nor female, but is far above

all human understanding. If
you study deeply the Writings of Bah�u�ll�h that portray both the

transcendence and immanence
of God you will find that the entire question of sex in this

context falls into total
insignificance.

 

On
the human level, the Bah�� Teachings stress again and again the equality of
men and

women. They do not ignore
the differences between the sexes, but repeatedly emphasize their

equality. This is a
universal concept, irrespective of the language in which it is expressed.

Regarding the pronouns which
refer to the Deity, in Arabic there is a distinction between

the masculine and feminine;
however, the Persian language does not make such a distinction in

pronouns between the sexes.
As you have noted in your letter, the style of translation into

 

The Use of the Masculine
Gender in the Bah�� Writings �������� ����������� ����������� 25
July 2002

Page 5

 

English was set by Shoghi
Effendi. In respect to the Sacred Writings, the originals clearly

cannot be changed, and the
House of Justice does not feel it appropriate to change Shoghi

Effendi�s usage of certain
nouns in his translations. The Guardian did not even approve the

changing of pronouns in
Bah�� prayers when they are read. Therefore, no deviation in

translation from the actual
meaning of the words, to accommodate the general trend of thought

and behavior affecting a
language, is permissible, unless, of course, the equivalent of the

original word does not exist
in a given language.

 

�Abdu�l-Bah�
says: �...in His estimate there is no question of sex.� �In the estimation of

God there is no gender.�

 

The
challenge, therefore, is to accept the use of pronouns in their generic sense,
which

will lead one to view the
matter in terms of a spiritual response, rather than one of semantics.

 

The
principle of the equality of men and women, which is firmly established by

Bah�u�ll�h and forms one of
the basic tenets of our Faith, will be fully realized as the human

race matures in its
understanding of the significance of His Revelation. Equality will be

achieved as a direct result
of the transformations the believers make in their attitudes toward

this fundamental issue, and
despite the exigencies of the languages in which the revealed Words

have been received and
translated.

(24
October 1996, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an

individual
believer) [8]

 

In response to your email of
21 August 1998 requesting guidance concerning the use of

�gender-sensitive language�
for use in your �discussions with potential authors and in the

editing of their work�, we
are able to provide the following comments.

 

The
Universal House of Justice has previously stated in response to a similar query
that

the use of �gender inclusive
language� is one of the many contemporary issues which challenge

Bah�� publications to adapt
editorial policies to the ever-changing public perceptions without

compromising the fundamental
Bah�� principles and concepts involved. It is the responsibility

of authors and editors to
acquaint themselves with the various points of view on the subject

current among the readership
which they are addressing, together with the prevailing modes of

expression. These factors
will exercise an influence on Bah�� editorial policy, but must do so

within the context of the
Teachings.

 

Clearly,
the Scriptures of the Faith, as revealed by the Founders and interpreted by

�Abdu�l-Bah� and the
Guardian, impose their own requirements on Bah�� authors and editors

alike. On the one hand, an
editorial board will quite properly be concerned to take into account

the preferences and
convictions common to the great majority of the intended readers of its

publication. On the other,
Bah�� authors must be left entirely free to discuss the Revelation of

Bah�u�ll�h in its own terms
and language as set out in the Bah�� Scriptures themselves and in

their authorized
interpretations, irrespective of current fashions in academic and other public

discourse.

 

It
is not surprising that the struggle to achieve such a balance during an era of

unprecedented social and
intellectual turmoil is very challenging to Bah�� publishers.

Inevitably, there will be
certain segments of the public who will object in some degree to

 

The Use of the Masculine
Gender in the Bah�� Writings �������� ����������� ����������� 25
July 2002

Page 6

 

whatever resolution is
arrived at in any given case, but this should not unduly distress either

Bah�� authors or Bah��
editors.

(16
September 1998, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a

Bah��
Publisher) [9]

 

The
Universal House of Justice has received your email message of 17 September 1999

requesting guidance on the
question of gender as it relates to the Deity and the use of gender

specific pronouns when
referring to God.

 

When
considering the manner in which masculine pronouns are used to refer to God, it
is

important to bear in mind
that when Bah�u�ll�h was revealing His Scriptures He had to use

language and forms of expression
which could be understood by those whom He was

addressing. This is the case
with every Prophet; He is compelled to use old forms through

which He will raise humanity
to a new level of understanding. In Arabic and Persian, as in

English and most European
languages, it has been customary to refer to God as �Lord� and

�Father�, rather than �Lady�
and �Mother�. While using the conventional wording,

Bah�u�ll�h devoted vast
numbers of Tablets to conveying the truth that God is not only neither

male nor female, but also is
far above all human understanding. If one studies deeply the

Writings of Bah�u�ll�h that
portray both the transcendence and immanence of God it becomes

clear that the entire
subject of sex in this context is essentially irrelevant�.

 

The
style of translation into English was set by Shoghi Effendi, and in respect to
the

Sacred Writings the
originals clearly cannot be changed. The Guardian did not even approve

the changing of pronouns in
Bah�� prayers when they are read. Therefore, when translating the

Sacred Writings it is not
possible to alter the actual meaning of the words to accommodate the

general trend of thought and
behavior affecting a language.

 

The
challenge, therefore, is to accept the use of pronouns in their generic rather
than

gender sense, which will
lead one to view issues in terms of a spiritual response, rather than one

of semantics. The Bah��
Teachings stress again and again the equality of men and women.

They do not ignore the
differences between the sexes, but repeatedly emphasize their equality.

This is a universal
principle of the Faith, irrespective of the language in which it is expressed.

## LITERARY
STYLE�TRANSLATION

 

## From the Writings
of �Abdu�l-Bah�

 

Regarding
the translation of the Books and Tablets of the Blessed Beauty, ere long will
translations be made into every tongue, with power, clarity and grace. At such
time as they are translated, conformably to the originals, and with power and
grace of style, the splendours of their inner meanings will be shed abroad, and
will illumine the eyes of all mankind. Do thy very best to ensure that the
translation is in conformity with the original.

(�Selections
from the Writings of �Abdu�l-Bah�, number 31.13)

 

## From the writings
of Shoghi Effendi and letters written on his behalf

 

This
is one more attempt to introduce to the West, in language however inadequate,
this book of unsurpassed pre-eminence among the writings of the Author of the
Bah�� Revelation. The hope is that it may assist others in their efforts to
approach what must always be regarded as the unattainable goal�a befitting
rendering of Bah�u�ll�h�s matchless utterance.

(Shoghi
Effendi, Foreword to �The Kit�b-i-Iq�n� (Wilmette: Bah�� Publishing

Trust,
1985)

 

It
must have been very distasteful to you to read some of the off-hand and
ungrammatical translations that more out of necessity than choice won
circulation and were even published. Furthermore, it was always the expressed
wish and desire of �Abdu�l-Bah� to have proper and adequate translations that
would not only convey the true spirit of the original but also possess some
literary merit. And for this he emphasized the necessity of a board of
translators. Such a board it has unfortunately been impossible to form as yet.

(28
March 1926 to an individual believer)

 

Shoghi
Effendi hopes that before long we will obtain a group of competent English and
Persian scholars who would devote their whole time and energy to the
translation of the Words and bring out things that are really deserving. For
whatever we have at present, even the very best, is only a mediocre rendering
of the Persian or Arabic beauty of style and fertility of language that we find
in the original.

(4
July 1929 to an individual believer)

 

Shoghi Effendi wishes me also to express his deep-felt appreciation of
your intention to study the Qur��n. The knowledge of this revealed holy Book
is, indeed, indispensable to every Bah�� who wishes to adequately understand
the writings of Bah�u�ll�h. And in view of that the Guardian has been
invariably encouraging the friends to make as thorough a study of this Book as
possible, particularly in their Summer Schools. Sale�s translation is the most
scholarly we have, but Rodwell�s version is more literary, and hence easier for
reading.

(23
November 1934 to an individual believer)

He feels the highest
literary standard possible should be maintained in any future translations of
Bah�� writings into Spanish, and for this reason he heartily welcomes the
suggestion to refer such work to Spanish professors....

(14
December 1938 to an individual believer)

 

There
is no objection to using, in translations of the Master�s words, a uniform style
such as �he does� or �he doeth�. It certainly creates a ridiculous impression
to use both. One or the other may be chosen.

 

In
Persian it is impolite not to use the word �FaGrat� before the name of the
Prophet, so that strictly speaking a proper translation should always have �His
Holiness Moses� etc.;

however, as this seems
peculiar in English, and not in the best usage of our language, he feels it can
be dispensed with. Pronouns referring to the Manifestation, or the Master,
should, however, invariably be capitalized.

(8
November 1948 to a National Spiritual Assembly)

 

Shoghi
Effendi himself uses the King James version of the Bible, both because it is an
authoritative one and in beautiful English.

(28
October 1949 to an individual believer)

 

He
is interested in accomplishing two things�he would like in the European
languages to have as much uniformity with the English translations as possible;
he does not wish the Bah�� translations to be in any way a flagrant violation
of the rules of the language into which our literature is being translated.

 

Your
Committee must conscientiously study this question, and then do the best you
can to have the Bah�� literature in French meet the high standards of the
French language and grammar.

 

If
the possessive and demonstrative adjectives and pronouns in French are never

capitalized where they stand
for �God�, then this should not be done in the Bah�� literature. If there is a
precedent for doing so in the French language, however, they should be. The
same is true of the attributes of God.

(15
February 1957 to the National Translation and Publication Committee

of
France)

 

## From letters
written by the Universal House of Justice

 

We realise that translation
is a very difficult task and that however good a translation is

there are always differences
of opinion, both as to accuracy and style. However, in translating

Bah�� Scripture it is
important to remember that the style in the original is an exalted one and this
aspect should not be lost when it is translated into other languages. It can be
noted, for example, that when the beloved Guardian was making his translations
into English he used a style that is far from being that of modern English
usage but is admirably suited to the richness and imagery of the original.

(12

A
translation should of course be as true as possible to the original while being
in the best possible style of the language into which it is being translated.
However, you should realize that it will not be possible to translate the
Tablets adequately into easy, modern Dutch. Many of the original Writings of
Bah�u�ll�h and �Abdu�l-Bah� are written in very exalted and poetic Persian and
Arabic and therefore a similar flavour should be attempted in the language into
which it is translated. You will see, for example, that in translating the
Tablets of Bah�u�ll�h into English the beloved Guardian has created a very
beautiful and poetic style in English using many words which might be
considered archaic and are reminiscent of the English used by the translators
of the King James version of the Bible.

 

As
you point out, a literal translation is often a bad one because it can produce
a

phraseology or imagery that
would convey the wrong impression, thus a translator is at times

compelled to convey the
meaning of the original by means of a form of words suited to the

language. However, a person
translating the Bah�� Writings must always bear in mind that he or she is
dealing with the Word of God, and, when striving to convey the meaning of the

original, he should exert
his utmost to make his rendering both faithful and befitting.

(29
October 1973 to an individual believer)

 

## From letters
written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice

 

Those who are entrusted with the task of translating the Sacred
Writings from the original into English should study the original very closely,
and then attempt to express as accurately and as beautifully as possible in
English that which the original conveys. To do this they frequently have to use
various different synonyms in English to give the best translation of the same
Arabic or Persian word when it appears in different contexts. Conversely, they
may have to use the same English word in different contexts to translate various
different words in the original. In doing this they attempt to follow the
example set by Shoghi Effendi in his magnificent translations.

(31
May 1981 to a National Translation and Revision Committee of a National

Spiritual
Assembly)

 

Translation is a very
difficult art�an art in which absolute perfection is unattainable. However good
a translation, there will always be those who would have preferred it
otherwise, for taste, which is undefinable, plays such a large part in such
judgements.

(20
September 1982 to an individual believer)

 

From memoranda prepared by
the Research Department at the instruction of the Universal

House of Justice

 

The question of which style
of Swedish should be used for the translation of Bah��

Writings is one that, we
feel, must be decided by the National Assembly of Sweden after

considering the views of
those who are expert both in translation and in Swedish literary style. While
it is not obligatory for them to follow the practice that the beloved Guardian
adopted in English, it would be useful for them to bear in mind certain aspects
of the problem which have been solved in English by Shoghi Effendi.

The originals of the Bah��
Writings are not only in three different languages (Arabic,

Persian and a few in
Turkish), which have very different characteristics, but are also in a

number of different styles.
Some are highly poetic and metaphorical, others more precise and

specific. In
English-speaking countries, as in most others, religion and spirituality are in
a

phase of eclipse; therefore
the vocabulary used to convey many profound religious concepts has fallen into
disuse. To attempt to express the highly poetic and allusive terminology of the

Bah�� Writings in plain,
modern English would either be banal or would make the passages

sound very strange and
foreign. The Guardian�s use of a style of English that is slightly archaic, a
style in which there is an abundance of spiritual and poetic terminology, acts
as a bridge between the English of today and the style of the Persian and
Arabic Writings of the Founders of the Faith.

(1
July 1985 to the House of Justice from the Research Department for the

Swedish
Publishing Trust)

 

Those
devoted believers who are currently engaged in translation work have a
difficult task, for the originals of the Bah�� Writings are not only in three
different languages (Arabic, Persian, and a few in Turkish) but are also
composed in a number of different styles. Some are highly poetic and
metaphorical, others more precise and specific. The translators must study the
original closely in order to attempt an accurate and beautiful rendition in
English suitable for the style and language of the original text.

## From �The
Priceless Pearl�

 

## THE WRITINGS OF
THE GUARDIAN

 

In
an age when people play football with words, kicking them right and left

indiscriminately with no
respect for either their meaning or correct usage, the style of Shoghi

Effendi stands out in
dazzling beauty. His joy in words was one of his strongest personal

characteristics, whether he
wrote in English�the language he had given his heart to�or in the mixture of
Persian and Arabic he used in his general letters to the East. Although he was
so simple in his personal tastes he had an innate love of richness which is
manifest in the way he arranged and decorated various Bah�� Holy Places, in
the style of the Shrine of the B�b, in his preferences in architecture, and in
his choice and combination of words. Of him it could be said, in the words of another
great writer, Macaulay, that �he wrote in language ... precise and luminous.�
Unlike so many people Shoghi Effendi wrote what he meant and meant exactly what
he wrote. It is impossible to eliminate any word from one of his sentences
without sacrificing part of the meaning, so concise, so pithy is his style....

 

The
language in which Shoghi Effendi wrote, whether for the Bah��s of the West or
of the East, has set a standard which should effectively prevent them from
descending to the level of illiterate literates which often so sadly
characterizes the present generation as far as the use and appreciation of
words are concerned. He never compromised with the ignorance of his readers but
expected them, in their thirst for knowledge, to overcome their ignorance.
Shoghi Effendi chose, to the best of his great ability, the right vehicle for
his thought and it made no difference to him whether the average person was
going to know the word he used or not. After all, what one does not know one
can find out. Although he had such a brilliant command of language he
frequently reinforced his knowledge by certainty through looking up the word he

 

 

 

-5-

 

planned to use in Webster�s
big dictionary. Often one of my functions was to hand it to him and it was a
weighty tome indeed! Not infrequently his choice would be the third or fourth
usage of the word, sometimes bordering on the archaic, but it was the exact
word that conveyed his meaning and so he used it. I remember my mother once
saying that to become a Bah�� was like entering a university, only one never
finished learning, never graduated. In his translations of the Bah�� writings,
and above all in his own compositions, Shoghi Effendi set a standard that
educates and raises the cultural level of the reader at the same time that it
feeds his mind and soul with thoughts and truth....

 

The
supreme importance of Shoghi Effendi�s English translations and communications
can never be sufficiently stressed because of his function as sole and
authoritative interpreter of the Sacred Writings, appointed as such by
�Abdu�l-Bah� in His Will. There are many instances when, owing to the looseness
of construction in Persian sentences, there could be an ambiguity in the mind
of the reader regarding the meaning. Careful and correct English, not lending
itself to ambiguity in the first place, became, when coupled with Shoghi
Effendi�s brilliant mind and his power as interpreter of the Holy Word, what we
might well call the crystallizing vehicle of the teachings. Often by referring
to Shoghi Effendi�s translation into English the original meaning of the B�b,
Bah�u�ll�h, or �Abdu�l-Bah� becomes clear and is thus safeguarded against
misinterpretation in the future. He was meticulous in translating and made
absolutely sure that the words he was using in English conveyed and did not
depart from the original thought or the original words. One would have to have
a mastery of Persian and Arabic to correctly understand what he did....

 

The
Guardian was exceedingly cautious in everything that concerned the original
Word and would never explain or comment on a text submitted to him in English
(when it was not his own translation) until he had verified it with the
original.

The Difficult Art of Translation�Selected Extracts

From Letters Written By and On Behalf of the Universal House of Justice

## Concerning the Translations of Shoghi Effendi

 

The
matter of translation is a major problem. As you yourself know only too well,
to

convey exactly the meaning
and flavour of a passage from one language to another is often

impossible and one can but
labour to approach as near as possible to the unattainable perfection.

Even our beloved Guardian,
whose skill in this art amounted to genius, characterized his

translation of the
�Kit�b-i-Iq�n� as �one more attempt to introduce to the West, in language

however inadequate, this
book of unsurpassed pre-eminence among the writings of the Author

of the Bah�� Revelation�
and he expressed the hope �that it may assist others in their efforts to

approach what must always be
regarded as the unattainable goal�a befitting rendering of

Bah�u�ll�h�s matchless
utterance.�

 

The
difficulty of translation increases when two languages express the thoughts and

metaphors of widely
differing cultures; thus, it is infinitely more difficult for a European to

conceive the thought
patterns expressed in Arabic or Persian than to understand a passage

written in English.
Moreover, the beloved Guardian was not only a translator but the inspired

Interpreter of the Holy
Writings; thus, where a passage in Persian or Arabic could give rise to

two different expressions in
English he would know which one to convey. Similarly he would

be much better equipped than
an average translator to know which metaphor to employ in

English to express a Persian
metaphor which might be meaningless in literal translation.

 

Thus,
in general, speakers of other European tongues will obtain a more accurate

translation by following the
Guardian�s English translation than by attempting at this stage in

Bah�� history to translate
directly from the original.

 

This
does not mean, however, that the translators should not also check their
translations

with the original texts if
they are familiar with Persian or Arabic. There may be many instances

where the exact meaning of
the English text is unclear to them and this can be made evident by

comparison with the
original�.

 

We
also feel that it is still premature to decide upon the question of the
International

Auxiliary Language. It is
quite clear from the Texts that any living or invented language may

be chosen, but the time and
manner of its choosing and propagation are not yet decided.

(8
December 1964, from a letter of the Universal House of Justice to an

individual
believer) [1]

 

A
translation should of course be as true as possible to the original while being
in the best

possible style of the
language into which it is being translated. However, you should realize

that it will not be possible
to translate the Tablets adequately into easy, modern Dutch. Many of

the original Writings of
Bah�u�ll�h and �Abdu�l-Bah� are written in very exalted and poetic

Persian and Arabic and
therefore a similar flavour should be attempted in the language into

which it is translated. You
will see, for example, that in translating the Tablets of Bah�u�ll�h

into English the beloved
Guardian has created a very beautiful and poetic style in English using

many words which might be
considered archaic and are reminiscent of the English used by the

translators of the King
James version of the Bible.

As
you point out, a literal translation is often a bad one because it can produce
a

phraseology of imagery that
would convey the wrong impression; thus, a translator is at times

compelled to convey the
meaning of the original by means of a form of words suited to the

language. However, a person
translating the Bah�� Writings must always bear in mind that he

or she is dealing with the
Word of God, and, when striving to convey the meaning of the

original, he should exert
his utmost to make his rendering both faithful and befitting.

(29 October 1973, from a
letter of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer) [2]

 

Translation
is, indeed, a very difficult art, and �Abdu�l-Bah� has explained that, ideally,

all translations of the
Sacred Texts should be made by competent committees, rather than by

individuals. At the present
time, unfortunately, there is seldom in any country a large enough

number of sufficiently
skilled persons who can be called upon to constitute such committees,

and the institutions of the
Faith have to rely on the services of such individuals as they can find

with adequate time and skill
to undertake the arduous work of translation.

 

The
Writings of the Faith are not in the nature of scientific treatises. One must
remember

that the Manifestation of
God is using the inadequate instrument of human language to convey

truths and guidance which
can raise mankind high above its present level of development and

understanding. He makes
extensive use, therefore, of metaphor and simile, and often

approaches a subject from
several different points of view so that its various facets and

implications can be better
understood. It would not be possible, therefore, to compile a list of

meanings for specific
symbols, expressions and words, since they may vary in their implication

from passage to passage.

 

The
translation of a passage can seldom be an entirely faithful rendering of the
original�

one just has to strive to
make it as faithful and befitting as possible. At the present time many

of the translations of the
Writings fall far below the desirable standard, especially in those

languages spoken by a
relatively small number of Bah��s, but time and an increase in the

number of Bah��s who have a
profound understanding of the Teachings as well as an

exemplary command of the
languages concerned will enable new and improved translations to

be produced. For the time
being we must do what we can with what we have.

(8
September 1985, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an

individual)
[3]

 

With
regard to your question about the style of English used in the translation of
Bah��

prayers, we are asked to
point out that finding an adequate style in English for expressing

beautifully the poetic,
metaphorical and allusive style of many of the Bah�� Scriptures is not

easy. The Persian and Arabic
of the Bah�� Writings are themselves considerably different from

the current styles and
usages in those languages. Shoghi Effendi�s solution of using a slightly

archaic form of English,
which is somewhat equivalent to the use in the original languages,

makes possible the use of
images and metaphors that might seem strange if expressed in

modern English.

 

Furthermore,
styles of writing are changing comparatively rapidly. If it were already

found necessary to use a
style different from that used for translations fifty years ago, one can

estimate that a further
change would be called for fifty years hence. One merely has to consider

the large number of new
translations of the Bible that have appeared, and are still appearing,

and yet many
English-speaking Christians prefer to continue using the Authorized Version in

 

The Difficult Art of
Translation � Selected Extracts� ����� ����������� ����������� 25

spite of its proven
inaccuracies. Holy Scriptures have a profound meaning for their readers, and

to change the familiar words
too often can be gravely disturbing.

 

Books
of Scripture themselves mould the language in which they are written. The House

of Justice believes that if
translators strive to render the words of the B�b, Bah�u�ll�h and

�Abdu�l-Bah� into English in
a way that reproduces as accurately as possible the meaning of the

originals, that is as
beautiful as possible, and that harmonizes closely with the style used by

Shoghi Effendi, these
Writings themselves will have a far-reaching effect on the ability of

Bah��s, and especially
Bah�� children and youth, to use the English language effectively for

thought and for expression.

(3
February 1988, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an

individual
believer) [4]

 

It
must be remembered that Shoghi Effendi�s translations carry with them a large
measure of interpretation of the intent and purpose of the Author of the text
he set about to translate�an interpretation which he, as Interpreter of the
Sacred Text, could alone authoritatively provide.

(27
February 1989, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a

National
Spiritual Assembly) [5]

 

You
ask whether the translations of Shoghi Effendi should be considered as the

�standard�
and whether, because of his function as infallible interpreter, the

Guardian�s
translations provide �the true interpretation of the Writings�. We are

asked
to call attention to the Introduction to �The Kit�b-i-Aqdas� where the

Universal
House of Justice describes the essential qualities of the Guardian�s

translations
and the fact that they �are illumined by his uniquely inspired

understanding
of the purport and implications of the originals�. 

(15
December 1994, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an
individualbeliever) [6]

 

The
Universal House of Justice has received your letter dated 9 August 1999 in
which

you seek to know how soon
will the Writings of Bah�u�ll�h be published in �the common

language of standard English
to facilitate teaching�. We have been asked to respond as follows.

 

The
House of Justice appreciates your desire to make the Writings of Bah�u�ll�h

accessible to your relatives
and others who may dismiss them as illogical because of the style in

which they are written.
Nevertheless, to attempt to express the highly poetic, metaphorical and

allusive terminology of the
Bah�� Writings in plain, modern English would either be banal or

would render many of the
passages strange and foreign. The Guardian�s use of a style of

English that is slightly
archaic, a style in which there is an abundance of spiritual and poetic

terminology, acts as a
bridge between the English of today and the style of the Persian and

Arabic Writings of the
Founders of our Faith.

 

In
comparing the translation of the Bible with that of Bah�� Texts, you may
realize that

the Hebrew of the Old
Testament is far more blunt and straightforward than the Persian and

Arabic of the Bah��
Writings. Additionally, the koine Greek of most of the New Testament is

the everyday speech of that
time. The challenges posed to translators of the Bah�� Writings are

much more exacting than
those that confront translators of the Bible. It is therefore not

advisable to use one kind of
translation as a standard for the other.

Finally,
although it is not possible to translate the Writings in a manner that brings
them

in conformity with the
standards of common English, you may be confident that if the hearts of

those
to whom you present the Writings are ready, the style of the Sacred Texts will
not stand as

a barrier to their
understanding and accepting the teachings.

## From the Writings of �Abdu�l-Bah�

 

Regarding
the translation of the Books and Tablets of the Blessed Beauty, erelong will

translations be made into
every tongue, with power, clarity and grace. At such time as they are

translated, conformably to
the originals, and with power and grace of style, the splendours of

their inner meanings will be

very best to ensure that the
translation is in conformity with the original.

(�Selections
from the Writings of �Abdu�l-Bah�, number 31.13) [1]

 

## From Letters written by the Universal House of Justice

 

It
is, of course, permissible to translate Bah�� writings into other languages
and dialects

of languages. It is also
possible to simplify or paraphrase the Bah�� writings in order to

facilitate their translation
into languages and dialects having small vocabularies. However, it is

not permissible to publish
simplifications and paraphrases of Bah�� writings as Bah��

Scripture.

(13
March 1969 to a National Spiritual Assembly) [2]

 

With
the exception of certain oriental languages such as Turkish, Arabic and Urdu,
which

are related to the original
Persian or Arabic, new translations of the Sacred Text into languages

other than English must be
made from the Guardian�s English translation where it exists. When

there is no translation into
English by Shoghi Effendi of a particular passage, the National

Spiritual Assembly concerned
should seek the advice of the Universal House of Justice. When

translations already exist,
which are not made from the Guardian�s English text, but have been

published and approved, they
may be used.

(28
March 1971 to all National Spiritual Assemblies) [3]

 

The
point is well taken that it would unduly delay fundamental Bah�i teachings
being

published in a number of
languages if we were to await the availability of Bah�is competent to

make the translations.
Summaries, commentaries and simple re-statements of the Guardian�s

writings, provided the text
itself is not attributed to the Guardian, are to be encouraged.

(13 August 1972 to the Hands
of the Cause of God in the Holy Land) [4]

 

We
realise that translation is a very difficult task and that however good a translation
is

there are always differences
of opinion, both as to accuracy and style. However, in translating

Bah�� Scripture it is
important to remember that the style in the original is an exalted one and

this aspect should not be
lost when it is translated into other languages. It can be noted, for

example, that when the
beloved Guardian was making his translations into English he used a

style that is far from being
that of modern English usage but is admirably suited to the richness

and imagery of the original.

(12

We have noticed a tendency
in a number of countries to attempt to translate Bah��

literature into the current,
easy, everyday language of the country. This, however, should not be

an overriding consideration.
Many of the Tablets of Bah�u�ll�h and �Abdu�l-Bah� are in

exalted and highly poetic
language in the original Persian and Arabic and you will see, for

example, that when
translating Bah�u�ll�h�s Writings into English the beloved Guardian did

not use present-day
colloquial English but evolved a highly poetic and beautiful style, using

numbers of archaic
expressions reminiscent of the translations of the Bible.

(7 October 1973 to a
National Spiritual Assembly) [6]

 

As
to Counsellor ��s question in his letter of January 22, it may be pointed out
to him that the translation and recording of some of the Holy Writings into
native dialects not only helps the teaching work and pays honour to the native
languages, but also provides the way to achieve an objective established by the
Master and the beloved Guardian. Both �Abdu�l-Bah� and Shoghi

Effendi often encouraged the
friends to memorize passages from the Writings and such a

practice acquires added
importance in areas where there is a shortage of printed literature or a

high degree of illiteracy.
Consequently, availability of passages from the Holy Writings in

native dialects is an important
aspect of a successful deepening programme.

(19
February 1975 memorandum to the International Teaching Centre) [7]

 

From Letters written on
behalf of the Universal House of Justice 

 

In
most languages each word has a range of meanings and also a penumbra of
connotations. Certain of these overlap, giving rise to synonyms which are
interchangeable in some contexts but not in others. It is seldom that there is
an exact correspondence between the range of meanings and connotations of a
word in one language and those of its nearest equivalent in another language.
This lack of correspondence is particularly evident between the words of
languages used in widely separate parts of the world or in verydifferent
cultures.

 

The
House of Justice feels, therefore, that to construct a rigid list of Dutch
words which

are always used to translate
certain other English words would not only be unnecessary but

definitely misleading. As
the beloved Guardian pointed out, the word �Bah� signifies at once

the �Glory�, the �Splendour�
and the �Light� of God; there is no single word in English

which can express all these.
Thus, as you have noted, it is translated as �Glory� in the use

�Bah�u�ll�h�, while in the
list of the months, where �Jal�l�, the second month, is translated

�Glory�, �Bah� is
translated �Splendour�. All translations are, to some degree, inadequate.

 

Those
who are entrusted with the task of translating the Sacred Writings from the
original

into English should study
the original very closely, and then attempt to express as accurately

and as beautifully as
possible in English that which the original conveys. To do this they

frequently have to use
various different synonyms in English to give the best translation of the

same Arabic or Persian word
when it appears in different contexts. Conversely, they may have

to use the same English word
in different contexts to translate various different words in the

original. In doing this they
attempt to follow the example set by Shoghi Effendi in his

magnificent translations.

 

The
House of Justice suggests that, although your committee should, of course,
follow

the instruction of the
Guardian to make your translations into Dutch from the English

translations rather than
from the original Persian or Arabic, you may find it helpful to consult

Persian believers who are
well-versed in Dutch and who could check with the original Texts for

you. This could help you to
make the correct choice of word in Dutch when the English

wording seems ambiguous.

(31
May 1981 to a National Translation and Revision Committee) [8]

 

Translation
is, indeed, a very difficult art, and �Abdu�l-Bah� has explained that, ideally,

all translations of the
Sacred Texts should be made by competent committees, rather than by

individuals. At the present
time, unfortunately, there is seldom in any country a large enough

number of sufficiently
skilled persons who can be called upon to constitute such committees,

and the institutions of the
Faith have to rely on the services of such individuals as they can find

with adequate time and skill
to undertake the arduous work of translation.

 

The
Writings of the Faith are not in the nature of scientific treatises. One must
remember

that the Manifestation of
God is using the inadequate instrument of human language to convey

truths and guidance which
can raise mankind high above its present level of development and

understanding. He makes
extensive use, therefore, of metaphor and simile, and often

approaches a subject from
several different points of view so that its various facets and

implications can be better
understood. It would not be possible, therefore, to compile a list of

meanings for specific
symbols, expressions and words, since they may vary in their implication

from passage to passage.

 

The
translation of a passage can seldom be an entirely faithful rendering of the
original�

one just has to strive to
make it as faithful and befitting as possible. At the present time many

of the translations of the
Writings fall far below the desirable standard, especially in those

languages spoken by a
relatively small number of Bah��s, but time and an increase in the

number of Bah��s who have a
profound understanding of the Teachings as well as an

exemplary command of the
languages concerned will enable new and improved translations

to be produced. For the time
being we must do what we can with what we have.

(8 September 1985 to an
individual) [9]

 

With
regard to your question about the style of English used in the translation of
Bah��

prayers, we are asked to
point out that finding an adequate style in English for expressing

beautifully the poetic,
metaphorical and allusive style of many of the Bah�� Scriptures is not

easy. The Persian and Arabic
of the Bah�� Writings are themselves considerably different from

the current styles and
usages in those languages. Shoghi Effendi�s solution of using a slightly

archaic form of English,
which is somewhat equivalent to the use in the original languages,

makes possible the use of
images and metaphors that might seem strange if expressed in

modern English�.

 

Books
of Scripture themselves mould the language in which they are written. The House

of Justice believes that if
translators strive to render the words of the B�b, Bah�u�ll�h and

�Abdu�l-Bah� into English in
a way that reproduces as accurately as possible the meaning of the

originals, that is as
beautiful as possible, and that harmonizes closely with the style used by

 

 

 

 

 

 

Importance of and Guidance
on Translating the Bah��

Writings into Indigenous and
Other Languages����� ����������������������� ����������� ����������� Page 4

 

Shoghi Effendi, these
Writings themselves will have a far-reaching effect on the ability of

Bah��s, and especially
Bah�� children and youth, to use the English language effectively for

thought and for expression.

(3 February 1988 to an
individual) [10]

 

Of
course the most fundamental requirement for the attainment of a good
translation is

the availability of a
translator who has not only a thorough understanding of the original

language, but also is able
to write in clear and beautiful French, so that he can re-express in

French not only the true
meaning of the original, but can clothe it in language which

appropriately reproduces in
the French idiom the beauty of style of the original. While a literal

translation is almost
inevitably a bad translation, the translator must guard against departing

from or adding to the
meaning of the original even though he may have to use a phrase to

translate a word, or reduce
a phrase in the original to one word in the French, or recast the order

of a sentence, or replace a
metaphor which would be meaningless if translated literally by an

equivalent one which conveys
the same meaning. In translating Shoghi Effendi�s writings in

particular you may find that
many of his long sentences, which are perfectly clear in English,

are impossible in French and
must be divided into shorter ones.

 

If
there is no French-speaking Bah�� with the requisite command of both English
and

French, or if such friends
are over-burdened, you may most certainly employ non-Bah��

translators. Here, however,
you may face another problem, that of the translator�s

understanding of the Bah��
teachings which underlie the words. It would be essential for you

to have such translations
carefully checked by knowledgeable Bah��s, who can raise with the

translator any passages
which they feel convey the wrong meaning.

 

When
you are having any of the Sacred Texts translated on the basis of authorized

English translations, you
should involve in the work one or more Bah��s who are fluent in

French and are also familiar
with the original Arabic or Persian. Thus, when the translator finds

he is unable to grasp the
exact meaning of the English words, his understanding can be

illuminated by reference to
the original texts.

(2
December 1988 to a Bah�� Publishing Trust) [11]

 

Translation
is indeed a difficult issue, and it is for this reason that the official
version of

the messages and letters of
the Universal House of Justice are sent in the original English. Any

translation offered is
unofficial and simply intended as an assistance to those who might wish to

avail themselves of it, and
National Spiritual Assemblies are free to make their own translation

in accordance with local
language needs. This also applies to the statement on Bah�u�ll�h

which the House of Justice
requested you to translate into Chinese.

(7
August 1991 to an individual) [12]

 

You
ask what is the purpose and wisdom of the translation of the Bah�� Writings,
and

what is the philosophy
behind it.

 

As
you know, one of the principles of the Bah�� Faith is for a single language to
be

adopted as the universal
auxiliary language of mankind, to be taught in the schools of all the

nations. When that time
comes, the need for so many translations will be greatly reduced, since

there will be one common
medium of communication for all who dwell on earth. Alas,

however, it will take some
time yet for the governments of the world to adopt such a farreaching

and fundamental measure.

Writings into Indigenous and
Other Languages����� ����������������������� ����������� ����������� Page 5

 

In
the meantime it is essential for the Bah��s to convey the Word of God to all
the

peoples of the world, as
quickly and as completely as possible. For this, translation is essential.

The Writings of the B�b and
Bah�u�ll�h are, as you know, in Arabic and Persian, as are those

of �Abdu�l-Bah� Who also
wrote some Tablets in Turkish. Shoghi Effendi, for his part, wrote

many of his most important
works in English. To expect the Japanese Bah��s to learn Arabic,

Persian and English
sufficiently well to really understand the Bah�� literature in those three

tongues would be too great a
demand. Fortunately, there is already a wealth of the Arabic and

Persian Writings translated
into English, but even if the friends� command of English is

sufficiently good for them
to fully comprehend such Writings, there is an important emotional

and psychological advantage
to their being able to read the Word of God in their own mothertongue. Thus we
engage in translating the Writings into even tribal languages which have quite
a small number of native speakers.

(14
December 1992 to an individual) [13]

 

Your
letter of 9 May concerning the translation of Bah�� literature into Georgian
has

been received and we have
been instructed to reply as follows.

You have asked whether
Bah�� literature should be translated from English or Russian.

In principle, the desirable
course is to translate from English, as the English translations have

been made by the Guardian or
authorized by the Bah�� World Centre. If this is not practical at

the moment, then provisional
translations can be made from Russian until such time as proper

translations from English
can be prepared. Such a solution is far better than waiting and being

without Bah�� literature in
the native tongue of your region.

(23
May 1995 to a National Spiritual Assembly) [14]

 

Equally
important is the right of the members of indigenous populations to learn,
speak,

write and communicate in
their native tongue, if they so wish, in addition to the official

language of the country in
which they reside, for language is the expression of the spirit of a

people and the vehicle of
its cohesive and inspiring traditions. Facility in one�s native language

in addition to the official
language of one�s country can produce an enrichment of the heritage

of the entire people and can
act as a stabilizing influence in society, while the cultural

oppression which seeks to obliterate
minority languages can have a deracinating and

demoralizing effect that
will be very difficult to correct. Furthermore, Bah��s advocate the

development or adoption of
an international auxiliary language by which all the peoples of all

countries and cultural
backgrounds will be able to communicate.

Dear Bah�� Friend,

 

The
Universal House of Justice has received your email dated 28 July 2002, and

referred it to our
Department for response. In answer to your request for materials on universal

auxiliary language and
universal language, we are providing for your use two documents which

address these general
concepts, namely, an extract from a Research Department memorandum

dated 7 July 1994, and its
attachment entitled �The Principle of an International Auxiliary

Language�. You may also find
of interest the enclosed documents �International Auxiliary

Language�, providing
references to this topic in the Bah�� writings, and �Bah�� World Centre

Library: A Partial
Bibliography of Published Works on an Auxiliary Language�, which lists

some papers by Bah��s on
this subject.

 

Regarding
your request for guidance on translating the Bah�� Writings, we trust that the

Research Department�s
memorandum dated 25 July 2002, and its accompanying enclosures,

which were previously sent
to you by email, will provide ample information on this topic.

 

You
have asked that email attachments be sent to you in a form other than

Portable Document Format
(PDF), such as Microsoft Word format. As it is the practice for

communications from the
Bah�� World Centre to be sent in only two formats, namely, plain

text (ASCII) and PDF, we
regret that we are unable to provide electronic copies of the above

documents in any other form.

 

We
hope that you will be able to glean adequate information from these materials
to assist you in your endeavors to make a presentation at the upcoming
Association for Bah�� Studies conference.

 

 

With loving Bah�� greetings,

Extract from a Research Department memorandum dated 7 July 1994

 

 

 

The
Research Department has studied the questions concerning an international
auxiliary

language raised by.... He
expresses the view that there is an urgent need for the world to adopt

an international auxiliary
language and for the Bah��s to be in the forefront of helping to make

this a reality. He indicates
a willingness to spend time researching and promoting this

undertaking, and to this
end, he raises a number of issues about the nature of such a language,

its promotion and its
relationship to the Lesser Peace....

 

 

1.��������  An International Auxiliary Language

 

We
attach a compilation of extracts entitled �The Principle of an International Auxiliary

Language� which addresses,
in broad terms, the issues raised by Mr. ... and which serves as the

basis for the comments which
follow. There are, of course, many other references in the

published Writings and in
the talks given by �Abdu�l-Bah� during His travels in the West, many

of which were collected in
Paris Talks and The Promulgation of Universal Peace. Additional

talks on this subject can be
found in a number of the volumes of Star of the West, for example:

 

volume
III, no. 3, pp. 23-24

volume
III, no. 19, p. 5

volume
IV, no. 2, pp. 34-37

 

In addition, there is a
chapter on the universal language in Pay�m-i-Malak�t, a compilation

prepared by Mr.
Ishr�q-Kh�var�. Some of the Persian friends living in ... would, undoubtedly,

have a copy of this book.

 

1.1
Degree of Priority?

 

With
regard to the role of the Bah��s in promoting an international auxiliary
language,

Mr. ... enquires about the
degree of priority that the believers should give to this activity at this

point in time. We call
attention to the following points, gleaned from the attached compilation:

 

-
Shoghi Effendi underlines the importance of an international auxiliary
language. In a

letter
dated 24 April 1939, written on his behalf, he refers to it as �an
indispensable

element
in the upbuilding of the coming New World Order�.

 

-
The Guardian summarizes the �whole question of an international language and
its

relation
to the Faith� in the following extract from a letter dated 17 October 1944,
written

on
his behalf to an individual believer:

 

We,
as Bah��s, are very anxious to see a universal auxiliary tongue adopted as
soon as possible; we are not the protagonists of any one language to fill this
post. If the Governments of the world should agree on an existing language, or
a constructed, new tongue, to be used internationally, we would heartily
support it because we desire to see this step in the unification of the human
race take place as soon as possible.

 

 

 

-
The Universal House of Justice in a letter dated 2 June 1982 written on its behalf

indicated
that �the important thing now ... is for the Bah��s to promote the principle�
of

an
international auxiliary language. It invited individual believers, who have �a
particular

interest
in this subject� and who feel so inclined, to study Esperanto.

 

-
With regard to overall priorities, in a letter dated 2 March 1976 written on
its behalf, the

Universal
House of Justice stressed the importance of �teaching the Cause and winning

the
goals of the ... Plan�.

 

1.2
The Nature of an International Auxiliary Language

 

Mr.
... enquires whether the Universal House of Justice sees the immediate need for

creating or adopting a
complex language, suited to �the exchange of ideas and the advancement

of understanding at
scientific, technological, commercial, literary and translation levels,� or the

development of �truly a
universal �second language�� that would enable people �to

communicate on a merely
social level�. We wish to note that, in the first instance, the

governments of the world
will select the international auxiliary language. See section 1.3

below for a discussion of
the timing of the adoption of an international language.

 

In
a more general sense, Mr . ...�s question impinges on the subject of the nature
of an

international auxiliary
language. Though the extracts contained in the attached compilation

deal mostly with Esperanto,
they appear to shed some light on the potential complexity of and

the functions which such a
language might be expected to serve. For example:

 

-
Shoghi Effendi, in letters written on his behalf, appears to have regarded
Esperanto as

a
vehicle for �introducing the Teachings into important social and intellectual
circles�

(28
May 1937). He called upon the believers �to learn it and to translate Bah��
literature

into
it� (17 October 1944), and he recognized its value in fostering �unity and

understanding�
(5 April 1947).

 

-
�Abdu�l-Bah� envisaged the development of a language �more complete� than
Esperanto,as it existed at that time. The Guardian indicated that the
international language of thefuture was to serve as �an international medium of
communication� (26 December 1936), as �a medium of exchange between the nations
and peoples of the world� (4 June 1937). And, the Universal House of Justice
indicated that it would �be used in all international commerce� (8 June 1980).

 

The
following two extracts from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi ... are
also of

interest as they were
responses to questions from individuals about the suitability of specific

languages to serve as an
auxiliary language. The final sentence of the first excerpt appears to

contain a general principle
to guide the selection of an international language:

 

He
was interested in your efforts to make the English language, which undoubtedly

is
the most generally spoken and widely understood, the world�s auxiliary
language, and

we
must wait and see how other European nations receive it. Of course as you had
well

put
it, the mere existence of prejudice is no ar gument against the possibility of
making an existing language universal. The world must try to overcome its many
defects and not

reinforce
it. Perhaps the main consideration in future will be the specific qualities of
a

language
as being exact, rich and easy to learn for both East and West.

(18 May 1928 to an individual believer)

 

Regarding
your question of �Basic English�s� usefulness as an international

language: He is not very
familiar with it, as he is too preoccupied with the tremendous

amount of work he has to do
here. But what little he has read about it makes him doubt

whether it would ever be
adequate to meet the requirements of an auxiliary tongue.

(30
June 1944 to an individual believer)

 

 

1.3
Relationship to the Lesser Peace

 

 

Mr.
... asks whether the adoption of an international auxiliary language will be
one of �the most important steps that needs to be taken to bring about the
Lesser Peace� or whether it will be adopted �as a result of the process of
establishing such a political peace�. Before addressing this issue it is
important to consider the way in which the international auxiliary language
will be adopted. In a letter dated 8 June 1980 written on its behalf to an
individual believer ... the Universal House of Justice calls attention to two
stages in this process:

 

...there
are two different provisions in the Sacred Texts for the selection of an

International
Auxiliary Language. On the one hand, this task is given to the governments

of
the world, on the other it is given to the House of Justice. It is not possible
now to

foresee
exactly how this will come about, but it would seem reasonable to suppose that,

long
before the Bah�� community is large enough or can exercise the authority to

produce
such a world-embracing change, events will compel the governments, either

progressively
or all in concert, to select an International Auxiliary Language to be taught

as
a second language in all schools and to be used in all international commerce.
At a

much
later stage, possibly at the time of the Bah�� World Commonwealth, the
Universal

House
of Justice may well decide to review the situation and either confirm the
decision

that
the governments had made, or change the choice to a more suitable language.

 

As
to whether the adoption of an international auxiliary language is a
prerequisite to the

Lesser Peace, the Research
Department has not been able to locate any clear statement in the

Bah�� Writings that relates
specifically to this question. It is, however, interesting to note that

the Universal House of
Justice in the Peace Statement identifies a �fundamental lack of

communication between
peoples� as a factor which �seriously undermines efforts towards

world
peace�. And the House of Justice indicates that the adoption of an
international auxiliary

language �would go far to
resolving this problem and necessitates the most urgent attention�.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

## THE PRINCIPLE
OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE

 

 

The
difficulties of international communication in a polyglot world are strikingly
evident

to any Bah�� who has gone
travel teaching to foreign lands or has attended international

conferences. The Universal
House of Justice feels that for it to choose any language for the

Bah��s to use as an
international auxiliary language would give rise to greater difficulties than

would thereby be solved at
the present time. The friends, however, remembering that this is

one of the very important
principles of the Faith, would do well to support the concept

whenever possible, and to
pray that the time is not far removed when the governments of the

nations will adopt a single
language to be taught in all the schools of the world as an auxiliary

to the pupils�
mother-tongue. This compilation has been prepared at the World Centre of the

Faith, on instruction of the
Universal House of Justice, to assist the friends everywhere to arrive

at a greater understanding
of this principle, to which �Abdu�l-Bah� addressed Himself in a

number of His talks in the
West.

 

## From the Writings of �Abdu�l-Bah�

 

Thou
hast written regarding the language of Esperanto. This language will be spread
and

universalized to a certain
degree, but later on a language more complete than this, or the same

language will undergo some
changes and alterations and will be adopted and become universal.

I hope that Dr. Zamenhof may
become assisted by the invisible confirmation and do a great

service to the world of
humanity.

(Tablets
of 'Abdu'l-Bah� 'Abb�s, vol. 3 (Chicago: Bah�� Publishing Committee, 1930

printing),
p. 692) ���������� ����������������������� ����������������������� ����������������������� ����������� [1]

 

As
to the Esperantists, associate with them. Whenever you find one with capacity,

convey to him the fragrances
of Life.... It is evident that the Esperantists are receptive and thou

art familiar with and expert
in their language. Communicate also with the Esperantists of

Germany and other places....
Grieve not over the apathy and coldness of the Hague meeting.

Put thy trust in God. Our
hope is that among the people the Esperanto language may hereafter

have a powerful effect. Thou
hast now sown the seed. Assuredly it will grow. Its growth

dependeth upon God.

from the Writings of �Abdu�l-Bah� (Haifa: Bah�� World Centre, 1982),

228, p. 308) ����� ����������������������� ����������������������� ����������������������� ����������� [2]

 

## From letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi

 

What Bah�u�ll�h says is
that the Supreme House of Justice will appoint a committee that will

study the whole matter and
then either choose one of the existing languages or create a new

one, to function as an
international language. The Master never went beyond that, i.e. He never

tried to solve the problem
Himself and choose that language. He still leaves it to the Supreme

House of Justice. But He
says that Esperanto will spread and even went so far as to encourage

all the friends who possibly
can to study it. In fact the knowledge of Esperanto has proven very

useful for one who tries to
teach in different countries of the world. But whether Esperanto will

become the
international language which is to be a part of our religious and social duties
to

 

 

 

 

 

 

THE PRINCIPLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE Page 2

 

 

study, no one knows, and we
have no evidence that the Master made any definite statement

along that line. The Master
has scarcely ever assumed the solution of a problem that

Bah�u�ll�h has referred to
the Supreme House of Justice. Esperanto may become an

international language, but
it depends upon the House of Justice to choose it as the international

language. And no one is in a
position to foretell.

(30
August 1928 to an individual believer) ��������� ����������������������� ����������� ����������� [3]

 

As
to your suggestion regarding a more widespread use of Esperanto among the
Bah��s

as a medium of correspondence,
Shoghi Effendi, as you know, has been invariably encouraging

the believers, both in the
East and in the West, to make an intensive study of that language, and

to consider it as an
important medium for the spread of the Cause in international circles. He

has been specially urging
the friends to have the Cause well represented in all Esperanto

Congresses and associations,
and by this means cultivate greater friendship and co-operation

between them and the
Esperantists.

 

But
in this connection, he feels, he must make it clear that although the Cause
views with

much sympathy and
appreciation the activities which the Esperantists are increasingly initiating

for the spread of their
language, yet it considers that the adoption of Esperanto by the entire

world is by no means an inevitable
fact. Neither Bah�u�ll�h, nor even �Abdu�l-Bah�, ever

stated that Esperanto will
be the international auxiliary language. The Master simply expressed

the hope that it may,
provided certain conditions were fulfilled, develop into such a medium.

(3
August 1935 to an individual believer)���������� ����������������������� �����������������������  [4]

 

Concerning
your study of Esperanto: the Guardian does not feel it advisable that you get

too busy introducing any
changes in that language, as this is not only a type of activity for

which you are not qualified,
but is also void of any use or advantage as far as your Bah�� work

is concerned, in view of the
fact that it is by no means certain that Esperanto will necessarily

develop into the world
auxiliary language referred to by Bah�u�ll�h in His writings.

(17
April 1936 to an individual believer) ��������� ����������������������� ����������� ����������� [5]

 

Regarding
the teaching of Esperanto: the Guardian thoroughly appreciates the efforts you

are exerting for the spread
of this language, and fully realizes that through them you can find

many openings for teaching
the Cause. He wishes me, however, to bring to your attention the

fact that neither
Bah�u�ll�h nor �Abdu�l-Bah� did specifically state that Esperanto would

certainly become the
international auxiliary language of the future. Neither did they enjoin its

teaching upon the believers.
What �Abdu�l-Bah� chiefly did was to highly praise it, and to

reveal its possibilities.
The teaching of Esperanto is, therefore, not a command or an obligation

in the sense that praying is
for instance. What is enjoined by Bah�u�ll�h is either the creation

of a new language, or the
adoption of one of the existing languages for use as an international

medium of communication. Let
us hope that Esperanto may some day develop into such a

medium.

(26
December 1936 to an individual believer) ��������� ����������������������� ����������� ����������� [6]

 

As
to your question as to what constitutes indirect teaching: it essentially
consists in

presenting some of the
humanitarian or social teachings of the Cause which are shared by those

whom we are teaching, as a
means of attracting them to those aspects of the Faith which are

 

 

 

THE PRINCIPLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE Page 3

 

more challenging in
character, and are specifically and solely Bah��. The teaching of

Esperanto, for instance, has
been a very useful way of presenting the Cause indirectly to many

people. It has opened many
doors of contact for the believers, and has lately proved to be of

tremendous help in
introducing the Teachings into important social and intellectual circles.

(28
May 1937 to an individual believer)���������� ����������������������� ����������������������� ����������� 
[7]

 

Regarding
the subject of Esperanto: it should be made clear to the believers that while

the teaching of that
language has been repeatedly encouraged by �Abdu�l-Bah� there is no

reference either from Him or
from Bah�u�ll�h that can make us believe that it will necessarily

develop into the
international auxiliary language of the future. Bah�u�ll�h has specified in
His

Writings that such a
language will have either to be chosen from one of the existing languages,

or an entirely new one
should be created to serve as a medium of exchange between the nations

and peoples of the world.
Pending this final choice, the Bah��s are advised to study Esperanto

only in consideration of the
fact that the learning of this language can considerably facilitate

intercommunication between
individuals, groups and Assemblies throughout the Bah�� world

in the present stage of the
evolution of the Faith.

(4
June 1937 to a National Spiritual Assembly)������� ����������������������� �����������������������  [8]

 

One
thing, however, the Guardian feels the believers should be very careful to
avoid in all such contacts with the Esperantists: namely that of giving them
the impression that they

consider Esperanto as
necessarily constituting that international auxiliary language of the future

referred to by Bah�u�ll�h
and stressed by Him as an indispensable element in the upbuilding of

the coming New World Order.

 

To
give them such a false conception of the true Bah�� attitude regarding the
choice of

the future world
international language would not only be an act of dishonesty and disloyalty

towards the Cause, but would
lead to serious misunderstandings and misapprehensions, and

eventually result in
counteracting the effect of any temporary gains or advantages which may

accrue to the Faith through
such association and contacts with the Esperantists.

 

It
is not so much that language as the central idea it embodies and inculcates
which the

Bah��s endorse, and only
through keeping firm to such an attitude can they hope to establish

any fruitful and enduring
contacts with various Esperanto groups and associations throughout

the world.

He
feels that this is a very important opportunity which you have now obtained of

teaching the Faith to the
Eskimo people, and he hopes your efforts will be crowned with

success.

 

He
would not advise you to teach them Esperanto, as we have no way of knowing

whether it will ultimately
be chosen as the auxiliary language of the world. He thinks the most

direct and quickest way of
communicating with them in a common tongue should be chosen; in

other words either you
should learn their language or they yours, whichever will yield the

quickest results.

THE PRINCIPLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE Page 4

 

 

We
have no authentic record of �Abdu�l-Bah�s in which He states that Esperanto will
be

the universal language of
the future. It may be Esperanto, it may be some other language, we

do not know; but as we believe
so firmly in the necessity of an international language, we are

always eager to co-operate
with the Esperantists.

 

The
thing of primary importance at present, especially in America, is the teaching
of the

Cause. With good will and
determination an auxiliary language�especially one of the nature

of Esperanto�can easily, and
relatively quickly, be learned; whereas the Cause requires that

people change not only
certain ideas but their very characters and habits, and this is much

harder to do and often takes
a long time!

(25
January 1943 to an individual believer) ��������� ����������������������� ����������� ����������� [11]

 

Regarding
the whole question of an international language and its relation to the Faith:

We, as Bah��s, are very
anxious to see a universal auxiliary tongue adopted as soon as

possible; we are not the
protagonists of any one language to fill this post. If the Governments

of the world should agree on
an existing language, or a constructed, new tongue, to be used

internationally, we would
heartily support it because we desire to see this step in the unification

of the human race take place
as soon as possible.

 

Esperanto
has been in wide use, more so than any similar language, all over the world,

and the Bah��s have been
encouraged by both the Master and the Guardian to learn it and to

translate Bah�� literature
into it. We cannot be sure it will be the chosen international language

of the future; but as it is
the one which has spread most, both East and West, we should

certainly continue to
co-operate with its members, learn to speak it and translate Bah��

literature into it.

 

He
feels you can rest assured that �Abdu�l-Bah�s statement, made in Paris, was
prompted by His insight and wisdom and not due to the opinions of anyone else.

Naturally the money of the
Cause should not be spent on translating and publishing

literature in international
languages that have no following worth mentioning!

(17
October 1944 to an individual believer) ��������� ����������������������� ����������� ����������� [12]

 

He
feels that the subject of the Bah�� work in Esperanto in Germany is a matter
for you

to take up with the National
Spiritual Assembly; we Bah��s do not claim Esperanto will be the

auxiliary language of the
future�but, as we firmly believe in the necessity of an auxiliary

language, we are glad to
support this work by publishing books in Esperanto and encouraging

the Bah��s to learn it, if
they wish to. Co-operation with this society is an excellent means of

spreading the Cause, as
Martha Root demonstrated in her travels. However, all details in this

matter must be decided by
the National Spiritual Assembly. You can contact Bah��

Esperantists in England and
the U.S.A. through their respective National Spiritual Assemblies.

(29
July 1946 to an individual believer) ��������� ����������������������� ����������������������� ����������� [13]

 

Regarding
your question about the Esperantists: for many years they have been one of

our closest contacts in
Europe, and many of them have become believers. They are working for

one of our greatest
principles, and we certainly should associate with them. In Germany the

 

 

 

 

THE PRINCIPLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE Page 5

 

 

Bah��s published an
Esperanto magazine, and Martha Root represented the Cause at Esperanto

congresses. We cannot say we
are sure this language will be the international one, but we are

anxious to see it spread as
it fosters unity and understanding. By all means foster your contact

with them. Whether Esperanto
will be chosen as the international language or not we cannot

say, but we can say we hope
it will spread because it nearly fulfils such a noble purpose.

(5
April 1947 to an individual believer) ��������� ����������������������� ����������������������� ����������� [14]

 

He
was also very pleased to see the contact with the Esperantists is being
maintained.

This friendly co-operation
with them, and attendance at their Congresses, is very good, and will

no doubt bring the Bah��
Cause to many of their members� attention. Also, he hopes, it will

lead to many of them
becoming Bah��s in the future.

From letters written by or on behalf of the Universal
House of Justice

 

Your
letter of 9 �AImat, 128 expressing your feeling that the endorsement by the

Universal House of Justice
of an international auxiliary language for Bah�� conventions would

not prejudice any future
World Government in its choice of world-wide tongue for official use,

and that Esperanto is widely
used by clerical, businessmen�s and scientific conventions, has

been received.

 

Regarding
your first comment, inasmuch as Bah�u�ll�h has said that the Supreme House

of Justice will appoint a
committee that will study the whole matter and then either choose one

of the existing languages or
create a new one to function as an international language, when

such a choice shall have
been made the action will automatically constitute an endorsement of

the chosen auxiliary
language.

 

With
reference to Esperanto, we share with you an excerpt from a letter written on
behalf

of the beloved Guardian by
his secretary to an individual in 1937:

 

The
interest which the Bah��s have and should have in this language is essentially

because
of the vital significance of the idea it represents rather than the belief in
its

inherent
worth as a suitable and adequate international medium of expression.

 

The
Bah��s indeed welcome Esperanto as the first experiment of its kind in

modern
times. They are in full sympathy with the Esperantists in so far as they stress
the

absolute
necessity for the creation of an international language to be studied by all
the

peoples
of the world in addition to their respective national languages.

 

As
to the most propitious time for the choosing of an international auxiliary
language, we

feel that it is not feasible
for the House of Justice to make the choice at this time.

(8
June 1971 to an individual believer) ��������� ����������������������� ����������������������� ����������� [16]

 

We have consulted about your
joint proposal for the formation of a League of Bah��

Esperantists, a �Bah��
Esperantista Ligo� (BEL), and have sought the advice of the Hand of

the Cause Adelbert
M�hlschlegel because of his long interest in Esperanto as an approach to

overcoming the language
obstacles which confront the world. He is enthusiastic. And we

 

THE PRINCIPLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE� Page 6

 

concur that such a League
would be helpful to the Faith as well as providing a useful channel

for teaching Esperantists
the world over.

 

1.
You are free to name the League as you have suggested. The significance of the

initials is a happy sign.

 

2.
Responsibility for the League will be exercised by the National Spiritual
Assembly of

the country in which the
secretariat is established. You have suggested that, at the outset, the

secretariat of the new
League might be in Brazil, under Professor Paul Amorim Cardoso as

Secretary. In that case the
National Spiritual Assembly of Brazil will assume jurisdiction of the

League in whatever ways may
be required during Professor Cardoso�s tenure.

 

3.
Whenever there are Esperantist events, congresses and the like, in various
lands, the

National Assemblies of those
countries should be informed of the prospective Bah��

participation, their
permission requested and their instructions followed with respect to any

Bah�� activities at the
congresses. For example, for the forthcoming Universala Esperanto-

Kongreso in Belgrade, you
should seek the advice and follow the guidance of the National

Spiritual Assembly of the
Bah��s of Austria, which has jurisdiction over Bah�� activities in

Yugoslavia, as well as in
Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

 

4.
You may, of course, publish whatever literature in Esperanto the League will be
able to

afford, remembering that
each publication must be reviewed and approved by the National

Spiritual Assembly in whose
area it is to be published. Such an Assembly may well, of course,

use members of the League to
review the translations. We ourselves shall bear in mind the need

for increased literature in
Esperanto, but the needs for literature in so many languages is

pressing and we cannot hold
out hope of providing any considerable amount of financial

assistance at this time.

 

5.
A request for special messages by National Assemblies or by the Universal House
of

Justice may be made by the
League as a part of its function of dissemination of the name and

principles of the Faith.

 

Your
zeal on behalf of Esperanto as a functional international language will, we
feel, be

well rewarded by the entry
into the Faith of many of your Esperantist associates who will thus

take the step from
universality in language to the greater universalities of one religion and one

mankind. We assure you of
our prayers for your labors on behalf of our matchless Cause.

(19
March 1973 to a group of Bah�� Esperantists) ��� ����������������������� ����������� [17]

 

As
English and Persian are the two official languages of the Universal House of
Justice

we regret that we cannot
write to you in Esperanto but we will be glad to enclose an Esperanto

translation of our letter
for you in view of the fact that you do not understand English well. We

hope that it will be
possible for Mr. Habibullah Taherzadeh to make such translations if his time

allows.

 

With
regard to the enquiry in your letter of 11 Jal�l, our understanding of the aim
of the

Bahaa Esperanto-Ligo when we
agreed to its formation was that it was to be an official nonneutral department
of the Universal Esperanto Association comprising those Esperantists who

are also Bah��s with the
aim of encouraging collaboration among such friends and promoting

the Bah�� teachings among
their fellow Esperantists.

 

THE PRINCIPLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE� Page 7

 

 

While
individual Bah�� Esperantists are, of course, free to encourage their fellow
Bah��s to study Esperanto this should not be an activity of the Bahaa
Esperanto-Ligo and it should be borne in mind that whereas it is clear that the
Bah�� Faith upholds the principle of an

international auxiliary
language no decision as to which language this shall be has yet been

made.

(10
May 1974 to the Secretary of the Bahaa Esperanto-Ligo) ����������������������� ����������� [18]

 

Further
to our letter to you of 2 December 1974, and with reference to your question on

the world language, the
Universal House of Justice has asked us to draw your attention to the

statement of Bah�u�ll�h in
the Eighth Leaf of the Exalted Paradise (see Bah�� World Faith, p.

182): �We have formerly
declared that speech was decreed to be in two languages, and that

there should be an effort to
reduce it into one.�

 

When
the beloved Guardian was asked by an individual believer about the meaning of

this passage, his secretary
gave the following reply on his behalf:

 

What
Bah�u�ll�h is referring to in the Eighth Leaf of the Exalted Paradise is a far

distant
time, when the world is really one country, and one language would be a
sensible

possibility.
It does not contradict His instructions as to the need immediately for an

auxiliary
language.

(29 December 1974 to a National Spiritual Assembly)������� ����������� �����������  [19]

 

The
House of Justice instructs us to say in reply to Mr. ...�s letter to the Local
Spiritual

Assembly of ... that he
should be advised that the time has not yet come for the Universal

House of Justice to take any
such step as he suggests. There is no doubt of the vital importance

of the establishment of a
universal language and it will inevitably come about but the believers

have more urgent matters to
attend to at the present and are asked to concentrate on teaching the

Cause and winning the goals
of the Five Year Plan.

(2
March 1976 to a National Spiritual Assembly) ������ ����������������������� ����������� [20]

 

The
House of Justice realizes that you must sometimes be faced with somewhat

embarrassing situations in
relation to your fellow-Esperantists since, as Bah��s, you are fully

aware that, for all its
undoubted qualities, Esperanto may well not be the international language

that is ultimately chosen,
and that it is the concept of an international language that the Bah��s

are enthusiastic in
supporting rather than any particular solution to the problem.

 

The
Guardian�s advice that Bah��s must be entirely open about this matter in
relation to

Esperantists so as to avoid
serious misunderstandings and misapprehensions in the future will

no doubt be of great
assistance to you in your work and enable you to forge ahead with full

enthusiasm without, in any
way, appearing to sail under false colors.

(6
October 1976 to the Bahaa Esperanto-Ligo)����������� ����������� ����������� ����������� ����������� [21]

 

You
are quite correct in stating that there are two different provisions in the
Sacred Texts

for the selection of an
International Auxiliary Language. On the one hand, this task is given to

the governments of the
world, on the other it is given to the House of Justice. It is not possible

 

 

 

 

THE PRINCIPLE OF AN INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY LANGUAGE�� Page 8

 

now to foresee exactly how
this will come about, but it would seem reasonable to suppose that,

long before the Bah��
community is large enough or can exercise the authority to produce such

a world-embracing change,
events will compel the governments, either progressively or all in

concert, to select an International
Auxiliary Language to be taught as a second language in all

schools and to be used in
all international commerce. At a much later stage, possibly at the time

of the Bah�� World
Commonwealth, the Universal House of Justice may well decide to review

the situation and either
confirm the decision that the governments had made, or change the

choice to a more suitable
language.

 

Of
course, conditions may produce a development very different from the one just

outlined. One of the
characteristics of Bah�� Administration is its flexibility which enables it

to deal with unforeseen
developments and continually changing conditions. The one certain

thing about the choice of an
International Auxiliary Language is that the Universal House of

Justice does not judge the
present time propitious for it to take any action in this regard.

(8
June 1980 to an individual believer) ��������� ����������������������� ����������������������� ����������� [22]

 

It is not yet timely for the
House of Justice to make a pronouncement in favour of any particular

language�the important thing
now, in this particular field, is for Bah��s to promote the

principle. Learning
Esperanto, or one of the other proposed auxiliary languages, brings one

into touch with people all
over the world who are conscious of the need, who are internationally

minded, and who may well be
attracted to the Faith. Therefore, if you have a particular interest

in this subject and an
inclination to study Esperanto, you should feel no inhibitions about doing

so.
