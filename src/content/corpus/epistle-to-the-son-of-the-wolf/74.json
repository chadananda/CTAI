  "translation": "Men have failed to perceive Our purpose in the references We have made to Divinity and Godhood. Were they to apprehend it, they would arise from their places, and cry out: \"We, verily, ask pardon of God!\" The Seal of the Prophets - may the souls of all else but Him be offered up for His sake - saith: \"Manifold are Our relationships with God. At one time, We are He Himself, and He is We Ourself. At another He is that He is, and We are that We are.\"",
