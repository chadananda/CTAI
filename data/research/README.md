Here is a set of primary documents, papers, and discussions you can cite, with direct language on the “unattainable goal” passage and with concrete examples, plus CTA‑specific material.

### 1. Core quotation: “assist others… approach the unattainable goal”

- **“The Difficult Art of Translation — Selected Extracts from Letters Written By and On Behalf of the Universal House of Justice Concerning the Translations of Shoghi Effendi”** (Research Department compilation)
  PDF: https://bahai-library.com/pdf/uhj/uhj_difficult_art_translation.pdf
  - Contains the key extract quoting his letter on the *Kitáb‑i‑Íqán*:
    > “…this book of unsurpassed pre‑eminence… and he expressed the hope *‘that it may assist others in their efforts to approach what must always be regarded as the unattainable goal—a befitting rendering of Bahá’u’lláh’s matchless utterance’*.” [bahai-library](https://bahai-library.com/pdf/uhj/uhj_difficult_art_translation.pdf)
  - Also gives the broader context (translation as “unattainable perfection,” status of his translations, and their use as a **basis** for other languages). [bahai-library](https://bahai-library.com/compilation_provisional_translations)

- **“The Art of Translation” – Bahá’í Library Online**
  HTML: https://bahai-library.com/miller_art_translation

### 2. Institutional guidance citing his translations as a *guide* or *basis*

- **“Translation and Provisional Translations” – Bahá’í Library compilation**
  HTML: https://bahai-library.com/compilation_provisional_translations

    - The need for translators to “follow the example set by Shoghi Effendi in his magnificent translations.” [bahai-library](https://bahai-library.com/compilation_provisional_translations)

- **Concerning the Translations of Shoghi Effendi (same as “Difficult Art”)**
  PDF (above) explicitly states:
  - The English translation should “form the basis” for translations into other languages. [bahai-library](https://bahai-library.com/pdf/uhj/uhj_difficult_art_translation.pdf)
  - The style of translation was “set by Shoghi Effendi,” and others are urged to harmonize closely with his style. [worldlanguageprocess](https://worldlanguageprocess.org/essays/uhj_on_gender.htm)

### 3. Detailed stylistic/lexical studies with concrete examples

### 4. Sources explicitly about his style as a model for others

- **“The Art of Translation” (same as above)**
  - Brings together UHJ extracts stating that the “style of translation into English was set by Shoghi Effendi” and that translators should strive for renderings “that harmonize closely with the style used by Shoghi Effendi.” [bahai-library](https://bahai-library.com/miller_art_translation)

- **Perdu & Velasco (above) – explicit methodological note**
  - They state that they used CTA, “a basic concordance programme and translation tool,” for their lexical comparisons between the original texts and Shoghi Effendi’s translations, giving you a concrete, citable example of CTA applied to his style.

### 6. Supplementary discussions and examples

  HTML: https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/bahaullah/tablets-bahaullah/8

If you tell me which of these you intend to mine first (e.g., Perdu & Velasco vs. the Research Department compilation), I can next just list page‑numbered example locations (e.g., “Perdu & Velasco, pp. X–Y: *nazm* → ‘World Order’ / ‘System’”) without additional commentary.



Here are additional items beyond the PDFs and formal articles, including discussion threads and smaller pieces where the “unattainable goal / assist others” line and his translations-as-guide idea are explicitly cited or debated.

### A. Primary text and official reproductions of the “assist others… unattainable goal” line

- **Shoghi Effendi, Foreword to the *Kitáb‑i‑Íqán***

### B. Academic / semi‑academic pieces that quote and discuss that line

  - HTML: https://irfancolloquia.org/4/stockman_terms/
  - Includes the *Kitáb‑i‑Íqán* Foreword line in full and briefly comments on its implication that translations are inherently limited (“unattainable goal”) but Shoghi Effendi’s rendering helps others approach it. [irfancolloquia](https://irfancolloquia.org/4/stockman_terms/)

- **Livius – *Revista de Estudios de Traducción* 5 (1994)**
  - PDF: https://hte.upf.edu/wp-content/uploads/Livius-5.pdf
  - Contains a section referencing the same sentence from the Foreword as a classic example of a translator framing his own work as provisional and exemplary. [hte.upf](https://hte.upf.edu/wp-content/uploads/Livius-5.pdf)

### C. Informal discussion threads about his translations as a basis or guide

- **Reddit: “I’m amazed at Shoghi Effendi’s translations being the basis…”**
  - Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/bahai/comments/qdorme/im_amazed_at_shoghi_effendis_translations_being/
  - Discussion revolves around the policy of using his English as the basis for other languages, often citing or paraphrasing the Foreword’s “assist others” and UHJ guidance that his translations serve as a standard. [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bahai/comments/qdorme/im_amazed_at_shoghi_effendis_translations_being/)

- **Facebook group “Baha’i Library & Resources”: misreading of the “unattainable goal” line**
  - Post: “Some people hold the view that this verse from Shoghi Effendi’s…”
    https://www.facebook.com/groups/2209644753/posts/10155235462269754/
  - Participants paste the Foreword sentence (“assist others… unattainable goal—a befitting rendering…”) and argue about whether it implies that all future translations must be judged against his or simply that he is offering one exemplary attempt. [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2209644753/posts/10155235462269754/)

- **Reddit: OnThisDateInBahai – UHJ letter and CTA**
  - Post: “March 8. On this date in 2015, the UHJ wrote ‘interlinear editions of…’”
    https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/1j5m0pn/march_8_on_this_date_in_2015_the_uhj_wrote/
  - Quotes from the 2015 UHJ letter about interlinear editions and mentions the Computer Translation Aid (CTA), in the context of maintaining consistency with established translations. [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/1j5m0pn/march_8_on_this_date_in_2015_the_uhj_wrote/)

### D. Discussion touching CTA and terminological precedent

- **Sen McGlinn, “UHJ elucidations” (blog post)**
  - HTML: https://senmcglinn.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/uhj-elucidation/
  - Includes a paragraph noting that Bahá’í translators use CTA (Computer Translation Aid) because “Bahai writings differ from those in Persian and Arabic dictionaries,” linking CTA explicitly with precedent‑based terminology choice drawn from Shoghi Effendi’s translations. [senmcglinn.wordpress](https://senmcglinn.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/uhj-elucidation/)

- **Bahá’í Library subject index for “* Translation” (includes CTA, policy, etc.)**
  - HTML: https://bahai-library.com/tags/*_Translation
  - Lists Computer Translation Aid (CTA) under translation‑related tags and points back to compilations where UHJ guidance on following Shoghi Effendi’s translations is collected. [bahai-library](https://bahai-library.com/tags/*_Translation)

- **CTA‑related UHJ letter indexed by Bahá’í Library**
  - “Interlinear Editions of the Bahá’í Writings” (already mentioned, but note again):
    https://bahai-library.com/uhj_interlinear_writings_cta
  - Describes interlinear projects, mentions CTA by name, and connects such tools with preserving consistency with authoritative translations. [bahai-library](https://bahai-library.com/uhj_interlinear_writings_cta)

These should give you additional URLs and contexts, especially for the specific Foreword sentence and for CTA’s role, that you can footnote directly without needing to summarize or rely only on the longer PDFs.
