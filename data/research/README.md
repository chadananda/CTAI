# Research: Shoghi Effendi's Translation Methodology

Research materials supporting the CTAI project's approach to computer-assisted
translation modeled on Shoghi Effendi's methodology.

## Core Thesis

> "The hope is that it may assist others in their efforts to approach what must
> always be regarded as the unattainable goal -- a befitting rendering of
> Baha'u'llah's matchless utterance."
> -- Shoghi Effendi, Foreword to the *Kitab-i-Iqan*

Shoghi Effendi regarded perfect translation of sacred text as inherently
unattainable. CTAI's multi-agent deliberation process is designed to
systematically *approach* that goal by surfacing every available precedent,
perspective, and terminological decision.

## Synthesized Translation Principles

Distilled from all 42 sources (see full bibliography for citations):

1. **The Unattainable Goal** -- Perfect rendering is impossible; the aim is to *approach* it through systematic effort
2. **King James Bible as stylistic model** -- Elevated register conveying sacred character, not mere archaism
3. **Absolute fidelity to the original** -- "You cannot change and leave out words"
4. **English synonym exploitation** -- Using English's richer synonym differentiation to capture nuances Arabic/Persian synonyms don't distinguish
5. **Endurance over accessibility** -- Language that lasts centuries
6. **Harmonic synthesis** -- Blending Jacobean, Restoration, Victorian, and Edwardian English into a unique register
7. **Interpretive authority embedded in translation** -- His translations sometimes clarify ambiguities in the originals
8. **Collaborative refinement** -- Working with native English literary experts (Townshend, Rosenberg, Esslemont)
9. **Three core standards** (codified by UHJ): accuracy of meaning, beauty of English, conformity of style with his precedent
10. **Chastity of style** -- Avoiding extremes, maintaining dignity and precision
11. **Writing aloud** -- Testing every sentence aurally
12. **Webster's 1934 Dictionary** as primary reference tool

## CTA: The Predecessor

CTAI takes its name from the original CTA (Computer Translation Aid), a DOS-based
concordance tool from the early 1990s used to support the translation of the
Kitab-i-Aqdas. Where CTA was a static reference showing *what* Shoghi Effendi
chose, CTAI is a dynamic collaborator helping translators understand *why* he
chose it and how to extend his methodology to untranslated passages.
