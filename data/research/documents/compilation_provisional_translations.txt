1. Selected Extracts from Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi

and by or on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice on Translation



From a Letter Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi



       He is interested in accomplishing two things -- he would like 
in the European languages to have as much uniformity with 
the English translations as possible; he does not wish the 
Bahá'í translations to be in any way a flagrant violation of 
the rules of the language into which our literature is being 
translated.



       Your Committee must conscientiously study this question, and 
then do the best you can to have the Bahá'í literature in 
French meet the high standards of the French language and 
grammar.

 (15 February 1957 to the National Translation and Publication
 Committee of France)[1]


From Letters Written by or on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice



       The matter of translation is a major problem. As you 
yourself know only too well, to convey exactly the meaning 
and flavour of a passage from one language to another is 
often impossible and one can but labour to approach as near 
as possible to the unattainable perfection. Even our 
Beloved Guardian, whose skill in this art amounted to 
genius, characterized his translation of the "Kitáb-i-Iqán" 
as "one more attempt to introduce to the West, in language 
however inadequate, this book of unsurpassed pre-eminence 
among the writings of the Author of the Bahá'í Revelation, 
and he expressed the hope "that it may assist others in 
their efforts to approach what must always be regarded as 
the unattainable goal -- a befitting rendering of 
Bahá'u'lláh's matchless utterance."



       The difficulty of translation increases when two languages 
express the thoughts and metaphors of widely differing 
cultures; thus, it is infinitely more difficult for a 
European to conceive the thought patterns expressed in 
Arabic or Persian than to understand a passage written in 
English. Moreover, the Beloved Guardian was not only a 
translator but the inspired Interpreter of the Holy 
Writings; thus, where a passage in Persian or Arabic could 
give rise to two different expressions in English he would 
know which one to convey. Similarly he would be much better 
equipped than an average translator to know which metaphor 
to employ in English to express a Persian metaphor which 
might be meaningless in literal translation.



       Thus, in general, speakers of other European tongues will 
obtain a more accurate translation by following the 
Guardian's English translation than by attempting at this 
stage in Bahá'í history to translate directly from the 
original.



       This does not mean, however, that the translators should 
not also check their translations with the original texts if 
they are familiar with Persian or Arabic. There may be many 
instances where the exact meaning of the English text is 
unclear to them and this can be made evident by comparison 
with the original.

 (From a letter dated 8 December 1964 written by the 
 Universal House of Justice to an individual believer) [2]


       A translation should of course be as true as possible to 
the original while being in the best possible style of the 
language into which it is being translated. However, you 
should realize that it will not be possible to translate the 
Tablets adequately into easy, modern Dutch. Many of the 
original Writings of Bahá'í and 'Abdu'l-Bahá are written in 
very exalted and poetic Persian and Arabic and therefore a 
similar flavour should be attempted in the language into 
which it is translated. You will see, for example, that in 
translating the Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh into English the 
beloved Guardian has created a very beautiful and poetic 
style in English using many words which might be considered 
archaic and are reminiscent of the English used by the 
translators of the King James Version of the Bible.



       As you point out, a literal translation is often a bad one 
because it can produce a phraseology of imagery that would 
convey the wrong impression; thus, a translator is at times 
compelled to convey the meaning of the original by means of 
a form of words suited to the language. However, a person 
translating the Bahá'í Writings must always bear in mind 
that he or she is dealing with the Word of God, and, when 
striving to convey the meaning of the original, he should 
exert his utmost to make his rendering both faithful and 
befitting. (From a letter dated 29 October 1973 written by the Universal
 House of Justice to an individual believer)[3]


       Those who are entrusted with the task of translating the 
Sacred Writings from the original into English should study 
the original very closely, and then attempt to express as 
accurately and as beautifully as possible in English that 
which the original conveys. To do this they frequently have 
to use various different synonyms in English to give the 
best translation of the same Arabic or Persian word when it 
appears in different contexts. Conversely, they may have to 
use the same English word in different contexts to translate 
various different words in the original. In doing this they 
attempt to follow the example set by Shoghi Effendi in his 
magnificent translations. (From a letter dated 31 May 1981 written on behalf of the
 Universal House of Justice to a National Translation and 
 Revision Committee of a National Spiritual Assembly.)[4]


       With regard to your question about the style of English 
used in the translation of Bahá'í prayers, we are asked to point 
out that finding an adequate style in English for expressing 
beautifully the poetic, metaphorical and allusive style of 
many of the Bahá'í Scriptures is not easy. The Persian and 
Arabic of the Bahá'í Writings are themselves considerably 
different from the current styles and usages in those 
languages. Shoghi Effendi's solution of using a slightly 
archaic form of English, which is somewhat equivalent to the 
use in the original languages, makes possible the use of 
images and metaphors that might seem strange if expressed in 
modern English.



       Furthermore, styles of writing are changing comparatively 
rapidly. If it were already found necessary to use a style 
different from that used for translations fifty years ago, 
one can estimate that a further change would be called for 
fifty years hence. One merely has to consider the large 
number of new translations of the Bible that have appeared, 
and are still appearing, and yet many English-speaking 
Christians prefer to continue using the Authorized Version 
in spite of its proven inaccuracies. Holy Scriptures have a 
profound meaning for their readers, and to change the 
familiar words too often can be gravely disturbing.



       Books of Scripture themselves mould the language in 
which they are written. The House of Justice believes 
that if translators strive to render the words of the Báb, 
Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá into English in a way that 
reproduces as accurately as possible the meaning of the 
originals, that is as beautiful as possible, and that 
harmonizes closely with the style used by Shoghi Effendi, 
these Writings themselves will have a far-reaching effect on 
the ability of Bahá'ís, and especially Bahá'í children and 
youth, to use the English language effectively for thought 
and for expression. (From a letter dated 3 February 1988 written on behalf of 
 the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)[5]


       Of course the most fundamental requirement for the 
attainment of a good translation is the availability of the 
translator who has not only a thorough understanding of the 
original language, but also is able to write in clear and 
beautiful French, so that he can re-express in French not 
only the true meaning of the original, but can clothe it in 
language which appropriately reproduces in the French idiom 
the beauty of style of the original. While a literal 
translation is almost inevitably a bad translation, the 
translator must guard against departing from or adding to 
the meaning of the original even though he may have to use a 
phrase to translate a word, or reduce a phrase in the 
original to one word in the French, or recast the order of a 
sentence, or replace a metaphor which would be meaningless 
if translated literally by an equivalent one which conveys 
the same meaning. In translating Shoghi Effendi's writings 
in particular, you may find that many of his long sentences, 
which are perfectly clear in English, are impossible in 
French and must be divided into shorter ones.



       If there is no French-speaking Bahá'í with the requisite 
command of both languages, or if such friends are over-burdened, you may most certainly employ non-Bahá'í 
translators. Here, however, you may face another problem, 
that of the translator's understanding the Bahá'í teachings 
which underlie the words. It would be essential for you to 
have such translations carefully checked by knowledgeable 
Bahá'ís, who can raise with the translator any passages 
which they feel convey the wrong meaning.



       When you are having any of the Sacred Texts translated 
on the basis of authorized English translations, you should 
involve in the work one or more Bahá'ís who are fluent in 
French and are also familiar with the original Arabic or 
Persian. Thus, when the translator finds he is unable to 
grasp the exact meaning of the English words, his 
understanding can be illuminated by reference to the 
original texts. (From a letter dated 2 December 1988 written on behalf of 
 the Universal House of Justice to Maison d'Editions Bahá'íes)[6]





2. Policies Governing Authorized and ProvisionalTranslations of the Bahá'í Holy Writings intoEnglish and their Publication

 

4 July 1999

 The principal purpose of these policies is to extend the use of provisional translations to publications in books and pamphlets, provided that they are of adequate quality, without involving the delays which would be required to have them thoroughly reviewed, corrected and polished.


 Tablets, or extracts therefrom, translated into English for use or publication by the Bahá'í World Centre will continue to be reviewed by an ad hoc translation and review committee at the World Centre and designated as authorized translations.



 Individual believers are free to translate into English any of the Holy Writings for their own use. Such translations may also be issued electronically, and may be published in circulars or journals without review by anyone other than the editors of the publications, but they must, in all cases, be clearly labeled as "provisional translations."



 If such translations are to be included in books or pamphlets intended for publication by a Bahá'í publisher, the Trust or private publisher involved should forward the manuscript to the Bahá'í World Centre for clearance, together with copies of the Arabic or Persian texts used in the translation. If the publisher is not a Bahá'í agency, the authors or translators themselves should forward the manuscript and the Arabic or Persian texts to the World Centre for consideration prior to the involvement of any non-Bahá'í publisher. If the translations are found to be of a quality adequate for publication, the manuscript will be returned to the sender with a note to this effect. Such translations should be identified as "provisional translations". If the translations are found not to be of acceptable quality, they will be returned to the translator for reworking. This procedure does not replace the normal review process for the book as a whole, which remains the responsibility of the National Spiritual Assembly within whose area of jurisdiction the book or pamphlet is to be published.

 




3. Letter from the House, 16 September 1992



The Universal House of Justice

Bahá'í World Centre

Department of the Secretariat



16 September 1992



Dear Bahá'í Friend,



The questions contained in your letter to ... about the
language of Revelation and the status of Shoghi Effendi's
translations were referred to the Universal House of
Justice. We are instructed to convey the following response.



With respect to your inquiry about whether, in the Bahá'í
context, English might possibly be regarded as a language of
Revelation, the House of Justice asks us to explain that,
while Shoghi Effendi's translations of the Writings of
Bahá'u'lláh into English carry with them a large measure of
interpretation of the intent and purpose of the Author of
the text -- an interpretation which he, as Interpreter of
the Sacred Text, could alone authoritatively provide -- one
should not conclude that the English language into which the
Writings were translated could, therefore, be considered as
a language of Revelation.



As to the special status of Shoghi Effendi's translations,
the beloved Guardian in a letter dated 15 November 1956
written on his behalf specified that "this English
translation" of a Text should form the "basis" for
translations into other European languages. The Universal
House of Justice, in a letter of 8 September 1964 underlined
the uniqueness of the translations of Shoghi Effendi and
provided the following elucidation: ...the beloved Guardian was not only a translator but the
inspired Interpreter of the Holy Writings; thus, where a
passage in Persian or Arabic could give rise to two
different expressions in English he would know which one to
convey. Similarly he would be much better equipped than an
average translator to know which metaphor to employ in
English to express a Persian metaphor which might be
meaningless in literal translation. 

Thus, in general, speakers of other European tongues will
obtain a more accurate translation by following the
Guardian's English translation than by attempting at this
stage in Bahá'í history to translate directly from the
original.



This does not mean, however, that the translators should not
also check their translation with the original texts if they
are familiar with Persian or Arabic. There may be many
instances where the exact meaning of the English text is
unclear to them and this can be made evident by comparison
with the original....



The Universal House of Justice has also clarified that while
the English translations of the Guardian might serve as a
useful resource, translations into Oriental languages such
as Turkish and Urdu could be made directly from the original
texts.



We are asked to assure you of the prayers of the Universal
House of Justice for the confirmation of your services to
the Cause of God.


With loving Bahá'í greetings,
For Department of the Secretariat, ...




4. Excerpt from a letter by the Guardian,
 14 August 1930

 Concerning the different translations of the Words. 
 It is surely the original text that should never be 
 changed. The translations will continue to vary as 
 more and better translations are made. Shoghi Effendi 
 does not consider even his own translations as final, 
 how much more translations made in the early days of 
 the Cause in the West when no competent translators 
 existed.

John Hyde Dunn, 14 August 1930
