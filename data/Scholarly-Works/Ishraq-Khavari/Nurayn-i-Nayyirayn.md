*Introduction*

*His most sweet Utterance, blessed and exalted be He:*

He had made mention of the Twin Shining Lights. Blessed be He! From him We heard mention of those for whom My Most Exalted Pen hath lamented, and unto whose exaltation and sublimity the Tongue of Oneness hath testified in the Tabernacle of Grandeur. O Muhammad! Well is it with whosoever is occupied with their commemoration, and who leaveth a record of their sufferings, whether in poetry or in prose, upon the pages of time. Hasan attained unto a twofold martyrdom, for throughout the days of his life he was selfless in the Will of the One True God. Whosoever hath assimilated his will and purpose to those of his Lord and Master hath, verily, attained unto true martyrdom. He attained likewise unto an outward martyrdom. Blessed be he and his brother, and he who was called Kázim.

*Here end the Words of God, glorified and exalted be He*

Isfahán, which was accounted the centre of Persian 'Iráq, held ever from ancient times -- that is, from before this blessed Revelation and the appearance of the holy religion of Islám -- in relation to the other inhabited parts of the world the rank of the eye; while in view of the plenteousness of its cultivation and the abundance and excellence of its conditions, it was famed as "Nisf-i-Jihán" ("Half the World"). The Arabian and Persian poets have each in turn uttered verses and composed rhymed epigrams extolling its merit; while the learned of every age and epoch have left in works of history and geography a complete and detailed account of the city, its situation, and the marvellous happenings and weighty events that have taken place in it at different times. One poet has said:

In calling Isfahán but half the world * they left the half of Isfahán untold!

The late Muhammad-Hasan Khán, Saní'u'd-Dawliy-i-Marághi'í, son of the famed Hájibu'd-Dawliy-i-Marághi'í, has in his well-known work *Mir'átu'l-Buldán* ("Mirror of the Lands") -- in which, as he says, he reconciled and made peace between history and geography -- written a full and circumstantial description of Isfahán, its virtues, affairs, historical happenings, celebrated rulers, artists and craftsmen, to which work and the like references the reader must turn for further information. Till now, more than twenty substantial compositions have been written and published about Isfahán, and from all these the importance of the city becomes clearly evident. After the appearance of this Mighty Divine Cause, the city received its share of the light of guidance. In the first instance, his honour the Bábu'l-Báb (Gate of the Gate) arrived in Isfahán on His way to Khurásán at the behest of the blessed Báb, and, tarrying there a while, guided a number of receptive souls to recognize the Truth of the Cause. Important people embraced the Cause during these times. Thereafter, this great city won, in consequence of its being honoured by the presence of His Holiness the Primal Point -- glorified be His Most Exalted Name -- renewed glory and respect; a company from each class and station turned towards the Cause of God, and consecrated souls laid down their lives in the path of His Holiness the Word of God. Although the martyrs of this land are many, and have, each in a distinctive fashion, proven the measure of their faithfulness through sacrificing their lives in the Divine Court, yet are the martyrdom and sacrifice of the Twin Shining Lights, their honours Áqá Mírzá Hasan, the King of Martyrs, and Áqá Mírzá Husayn, the Beloved of Martyrs, a different tale. The Pen of His Holiness the Ancient Beauty -- glorified be His mention and praise -- has, in a Blessed Tablet revealed in honour of the late Áqá Mírzá Áqáy-i-Afnán, Núri'd-Dín -- upon whom be the Glory of God -- provided the following explanation concerning the martyrdom of these twin holy souls.

*His most exalted and sweetest Utterance:*

...Observe thou that the Prince of the World was martyred under the circumstances that have reached thy blessed ears, while these are accounted among His servants. Yet observably the effect of their martyrdom is greater, its influence more complete, and its pain more searing. Exalted be He Who raised them up. Exalted be He Who honoured them. Exalted be He Who caused them to win this station, in striving after which God's chosen ones have laid down their lives ... *Finis*.

These two brothers, who were the sons of his honour Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, had the honour of entering the blessed presence of the Báb on the evening when their father invited Him to his home. His honour the Beloved of Martyrs was at that time eleven years old, while his honour the King of Martyrs was nine years old. In the course of that reception they were privileged to wait upon the Blessed Báb. Thereafter, having travelled to Baghdád in the company of their esteemed uncle, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, they had the further honour of entering the blessed presence of the Ancient Beauty, and attained unto the degrees of certitude, belief and assurance. The unseen favours of the True One encompassed these two holy souls, and God so willed it that in addition to faith, which is the real and genuine wealth, they should enjoy outward and material wealth and affluence as well. For a while they lived in Isfahán in glory and honour, and were known and famous under all conditions for their association with the Blessed Cause; nor did the blame of the blamers deter them from following in the way of God. They bore themselves towards all men, whether or not believers, with the utmost solicitude and kindness, becoming to each sick one a caring physician, and to each poor one a shelter and a refuge. In the famine of 1288, they saved a great number from certain death and starvation, and every tongue was eloquent in their praise and commendation. Throughout all the days of their life they never for a single moment concealed their faith, and accounted their association with the illustrious Divine Lote Tree a tremendous honour. So their days passed until, when the hour appointed for the Supreme Sacrifice arrived, they laid down their lives with perfect steadfastness and detachment. In the words of Bahá'u'lláh, wealth did not prevent them from turning towards the Holy Court of the True One. For long after the event, in every Tablet that was revealed, the Pen of God and the Tongue of Grandeur of the Ancient Beauty extolled them. In truth, it would be beyond the power of this feeble servant to record all the Tablets that were revealed by the Pen of God, both before and after their martyrdom, in honour of these two holy souls. Perchance their bereaved survivors and relatives may gradually amass those blessed Writings, and, compiling them in a special volume, undertake to print and publish it. Despite the acute eye affection which is his constant troublesome companion, this servant, placing his whole trust in Him Who is the Ever-Living, the All-Powerful, and beseeching confirmation from the heaven of Divine grace, has nevertheless to the extent possible assembled a collection of the Divine Tablets, and made use of the requisite available documents and sources so that at length, through the assistance and favour of God, this notebook has taken shape, and became available for the use of the friends of God. Of the Blessed Tablets revealed from the heaven of the Will of God, only such as were needful were set down in this notebook: for were I to include all the Blessed Tablets that have streamed forth from the pens of the Ancient Beauty, of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, and of his Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God concerning the Twin Shining Lights and their survivors and relatives, this booklet, which is intended to be concise, would swell into a substantial volume. At the end of this treatise I have appended various historical materials, in both verse and prose, that have survived from some of the learned of the Cause of God, so that these precious writings, which are the fruit of the thoughts, and the effusions of the pens, of the learned in Bahá' and of those knowledgeable in the Blessed Cause may remain safe from the peril of obliteration and disappearance; and that they may form the musk-scented conclusion of this notebook. This notebook includes an account of the ancestors of the Twin Shining Lights, and a relation of the martyrdom of these two noble souls, in both of which all due brevity has been observed. In the compilation of this booklet, recourse has been had to the blessed Divine Tablets; to the work *Memorials of the Faithful* by His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá; to the short history composed by her Holiness Munírih Khánum, the respected Consort of the Centre of the Covenant and Testament of God; to the treatise by his honour Abu'l-Fadá'il-i-Gulpáygání; to the researches and brief history of the late Áqá Mírzá Asadu'lláh Fádil-i-Mázindarání, and to the second and third volumes of his work *Zuhúru'l-Haqq* ("The Appearance of the Truth"); to the Mathnaví of the late Áqá Mírzá 'Alí-Ashraf, 'Andalíb-i-Láhíjání; to the reminiscences of the early believers in the Cause, who had the honour of coming into their presence; and to other historical sources outside the Cause. In conclusion, I beseech the friends of God to remember, and to bring happiness and joy to, this lowly servant through their kind prayers on his behalf.

The Forbears and Paternal Uncles

Of the Twin Shining Lights

*Hájí Siyyid Muhammad-i-Hindí*

His honour Hájí Siyyid Muhammad was originally a native of Zavárih, in the region of Isfahán. Having passed his childhood in that town, he decided, after attaining the years of puberty and discretion, to emigrate to India, and to make that country his home. This intention was duly fulfilled, and he eventually rested from his travels in one of the cities of that vast land. By chance, one of its wealthy inhabitants, who was a follower of the Shí'ah school, and held the descendants of His Holiness, the Best of Mortals -- blessings and salutations be upon Him -- in the highest esteem, observing upon the brow of that young Siyyid the signs of both outward and inner perfection, chose to make him his son-in-law; and as a result of this happy event Siyyid Muhammad came into the possession of great riches and a considerable fortune. He made haste to undertake the pilgrimage to the House of God in Mecca the Blessed, and, having returned from visiting those holy precincts, dwelt in that same city of the Indian Sub-continent, living at the height of glory, honour, wealth and respect, until the angel of death arrived; he answered the call of the True One; and, agreeably with the noble saying, "Every soul shall taste of death," he winged his flight from this mortal dust-heap unto the rose garden of the spiritual worlds. As mentioned at the outset of these remarks, Siyyid Muhammad dwelt originally in the area around Isfahán; but in view of his long sojourn in the Indian sub-continent, he became known as Hájí Siyyid Muhammad-i-*Hindí*. He left behind him an illustrious son by the name of Hájí Siyyid Mihdí.

*Hájí Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Nahrí*

After the death of Hájí Siyyid Muhammad-i-Hindí, his distinguished son, his honour Hájí Siyyid Mihdí known as "Nahrí," took his father's place, and continued for a while in India, enjoying the fullest measure of respect and fame. Then, after a certain period, he gathered up his limitless wealth, and, setting out for the Exalted Thresholds, fixed his residence in the city of Najaf, where he expended his riches in founding caravanserais, houses, baths and trading quarters, amassing in the process numerous properties, estates and lands. Among the charitable works he successfully undertook was to construct for the benefit of the people of those parts a water channel ("*nahr*"), by which means he removed a problem they had been facing. Thereafter he became known and celebrated as Hájí Siyyid Mihdíy-i-*Nahrí*. In the course of his sojourn in 'Iráq news reached him of the teaching and activities of his honour Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá'í -- may he be the object of God's mercy and good pleasure -- and he joined the ranks of the followers of that celebrated man of learning. After a period he conceived a longing for his native land, and so, having provided the means, and made all necessary preparations, for his journey he set out from Najaf for Isfahán, and fixed his abode in that fragrant city. The story of his marriage has a preamble, which we set forth in what follows:

At that time, one of the well-known divines of Isfahán, who was accounted a leader of the people and an authority to whom all, high and low alike, might turn, was the late Hájí Siyyid Muhammad-Báqir, Hujjatu'l-Islám. His father was Siyyid Muhammad-Taqíy-i-Músavíy-i-Shaftíy-i-Rashtí (Shaft is a village near Rasht in Gílán), whence the said Hujjatu'l-Islám was called "Siyyid-i-Shaftí." He wielded unbounded influence and enormous power, and had completed his various studies under such leading 'ulamá as Siyyid-i-Bahru'l-'Ulúm; the author of the *Ríyád* and the *Kashfu'l-Ghitá'*; Mullá Mihdíy-i-Naráqí; Mírzáy-i-Qumí, and others. The author of the *Rayhánatu'l-Adab* avers in his account of him, "To describe his magnificence is beyond the power of speech or writing to accomplish." He is the author of numerous compositions, which would fill near twenty volumes. He used himself to administer the penalties prescribed by Muslim law, and is said to have executed by his own hand a number of people pursuant to its provisions, and to have brought about the deaths of others by pronouncing them worthy of this punishment under the religious law. Some estimate the number of those whose deaths he caused to be as many as 120. Hujjatu'l-Islám Shaftí is the same who, as Nabíl-i-Zarandí records in his Narrative, took violent issue from the outset with the disciples of Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá'í and Siyyid-i-Rashtí -- may God have mercy upon them -- nay, stubbornly opposed them, considering both the Shaykh and the Siyyid, and the followers of those two saintly figures, as unbelievers and seceders from the holy religion of Islám. The late Siyyid Kázim sent his honour Mullá Husayn-i-Bushrú'í (who was afterwards named the "Bábu'l-Báb") to Isfahán in order to engage with Siyyid-i-Shaftí in debate. After a number of meetings with the Hujjatu'l-Islám, Mullá Husayn succeeded in guiding him to a true perception of the matter, and proving to him that the teachings of the Shaykh and the Siyyid in no wise conflicted with Islám. Thereafter, Siyyid-i-Shaftí made up for his previous opposition, observing the utmost respect towards the Shaykh and the Siyyid. He even wrote in his own hand a letter to this effect, and sent it through the offices of Mullá Husayn-i-Bushrú'í to his honour Siyyid Kázim-i-Rashtí. Finally, in the year 1260 A.H., ere the Báb had declared His Mission, he died of dropsy aged eighty-five, and was buried in a mosque he himself had constructed, and which is known consequently as the "Mosque of the Siyyid," in the Bíd-Ábád district of Isfahán. At all events, the point of this introduction is that the wife of Hujjatu'l-Islám Shaftí was a disciple of the Shaykh and the Siyyid -- may God have mercy upon them -- and that when his honour Hájí Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Nahrí arrived in Isfahán, and made there his home, he took to wife a lady from the kinsfolk of the wife of the Hujjatu'l-Islám, from which union there sprang a number of scions of his illustrious stock; to whit: his honour Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí; his honour Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí; and his honour Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím Áqá. I now provide an account of each of these in turn.

*Photograph of Áqá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Isfahání (Nahrí), father of the blessed Consort of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá*

*Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí*

This illustrious personage was born in Isfahán, where, after reaching maturity, he devoted himself to the pursuit of science and knowledge. He spent his days and nights at the Madrisih of Kásih-Garán, and exerted a mighty effort to acquire the recognized sciences of the age. So he passed his days for a while until, that he might perfect his attainments, he set off for Arabian 'Iráq, and took up residence in Karbilá the Exalted. Aided by a watchful fortune and by a favourable conjunction of circumstances and fates, he found his way into the circle of Hájí Siyyid Kázim-i-Rashtí -- may he be the object of God's mercy and good pleasure -- and became occupied in imbibing from the ocean of the learning of that heavenly doctor. In that same blessed city he chose for himself a bride; and during the period when, ere the declaration of His Mission, His Holiness the Primal Point -- glorified be His most exalted mention -- came to Karbilá, and tarried there a while, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí was privileged on several occasions to meet Him in the sacred precincts of the shrine of His Holiness the Prince of Martyrs -- peace be upon Him -- and became enthralled and enraptured by that Pure Being. His distinguished brother Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, as will be related hereafter, shared likewise in this bounty; and when the fame of the Blessed Cause was noised abroad from Shíráz, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, leaving his wife in Karbilá, set out with his brother Áqá Mírzá Hádí for that city. There he heard that the Báb had gone on pilgrimage to the Holy Kaaba. During these days, Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí and his brother chanced to meet Mullá Husayn-i-Bushrú'í, and, having attained through him to a perfect understanding of the Manifestation of His Holiness the Lord of Lords, and obtained a sufficient measure of belief and certitude, set out in his company for Isfahán, whence they made for Shíráz, that image of Paradise, and were honoured to meet the Promised One of God. The companions of the Blessed Báb were at that time converging upon Shíráz from all quarters in daily increasing numbers, and these, at His bidding, occupied themselves during the daytime in various corners of the city with some work or trade; while in the evening, depending upon the circumstances, they were honoured to come, with His permission, into His Most Luminous Presence. Of this number were Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí; his brother Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí; Mullá 'Abdu'l-Karím-i-Qazvíní; and others. After countless happenings, the companions were eventually dismissed by the Báb, each to a different quarter. Among them, Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, as will be recounted hereafter, returned to Karbilá, while Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí went back to Isfahán and remained there. After a while, news arrived of the passing of his wife in Karbilá, and in consequence he forsook entirely his intention of journeying to that city, and resumed his residence in the Madrisih of Kásih-Garán in Isfahán. Some while later, a merchant of Isfahán by the name of Hájí Áqá Muhammad gave Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí his daughter to wife; yet she too, like her predecessor, bore him no offspring. So matters persisted until His Holiness the Exalted One -- glorified be His mention -- arrived from Shíráz in Isfahán, and on an evening when, at the invitation of Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím Áqá, the brother of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, the Blessed Báb was a guest in the former's home, His host besought Him to grant that God might bestow upon Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí a child. This favour the Báb granted, with the result that God bestowed upon him a distinguished daughter, whom he named Fátimih -- the same who was subsequently given the title of "Munírih Khánum," and had the honour of serving the Most Mighty Branch of God as helpmeet. God bestowed upon Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí other children besides, accounts of whom will in due course be provided. Not to prolong the tale, when, some considerable period after this event, His Holiness the Báb issued to the believers the command "Hasten to the land of Khá'!," Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, upon hearing this blessed call, set out with his brother Áqá Mírzá Hádí from Isfahán for Mashhad in Khurásán, eventually participating in the Conference of Badasht, while both brothers bore fully too the consequences of the upheaval of Níyálá: Mírzá Hádí met his death under circumstances to be related in our account of him; while Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí proceeded alone to Tihrán, from whence he made his way to Isfahán, there ending his travels. Their honours Áqá Mírzá Hasan, the King of Martyrs, and Áqá Mírzá Husayn, the Beloved of Martyrs, the sons of Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, attained through the instrumentality of their esteemed uncle, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, to the Most Great Guidance, and, under circumstances that -- God willing -- we shall set forth, seized from their peers the palm in the arena faithfulness and self-abnegation, rewriting the scroll of the sufferings of the martyrs in the path of God in bygone days. Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí was survived by one son named Siyyid Yahyá, and by three daughters named Fátimih Khánum, Rádíyih Begum and Gawhar Begum. The most famous of his children is the aforesaid Fátimih Khánum entitled "Munírih Khánum," an account of whom I shall now set forth in order to enhance the benefit of this narration.

*Fátimih Khánum Entitled "Munírih," The Blessed Consort of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, Exalted Be His Sovereignty*

As was mentioned above, the father of her Holiness Munírih Khánum was the illustrious Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahríy-i-Isfahání. This honoured lady had been adorned with the ornament of existence, and stepped forth out of the unseen into the visible realm, thanks solely to the will and favour of His Holiness the Exalted One. A little earlier it was recorded that His Holiness the Exalted One honoured Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, the son of Hájí Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Nahrí, in response to his invitation, with a visit one evening to his home. The latter, out of respect for his revered Guest, had bidden to the occasion other company as well, among whom were Mír Siyyid Muhammad, the Imám-Jum'ih, the Sultánu'l-'Ulamá; his brother Mír Muhammad-Husayn; Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Ridáy-i-Pá-Qal'i'í; Hájí Muhammad-i-Tájir, the father-in-law of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí; Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, and his brother Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, who were brothers of the host; Mullá Muhammad-Taqíy-i-Harátí, and others. While dinner was being served, the Báb gave with His own hand a portion of the food to Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, tacitly conveying to him the joyful tidings that a distinguished child would be born to him. Subsequently God in His mercy bestowed upon him a happy-fated daughter, whom he named Fátimih. (The manner of her becoming known by the title "Munírih Khánum" will be related hereafter). From the account she wrote of herself, it may be inferred that she was born in the year 1264 A.H., at a time when the Báb's companions were sustaining the depredations and assault of the enemy in Níyálá. Ere he set out from Isfahán for Khurásán, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí had addressed to his respected consort these words: "We are journeying in a path that is the Path of God, and the end of our enterprise is unknown. If, therefore, after the birth of thy child, it be a girl, thou shalt bestow upon her the name of Fátimih, and if it be a boy, do thou name him 'Alí." In fine, according to Munírih Khánum's account, the intention of her illustrious father had been to send his daughter to the Most Holy Court, so that she might occupy herself with rendering services to the dwellers of the Tabernacle of Inviolable and Spotless Sanctity; but before this aim could be achieved, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí passed away, leaving Fátimih Khánum to grow and develop by degrees until she became a ripe and lovely sapling.

Not long after this, a Tablet arrived from the Most Holy Court in honour of the King of Martyrs and his brother the Beloved of Martyrs, which contained a statement to this effect: "Such is the Divine grace vouchsafed unto you that He hath appointed you members of the Holy Family and relations of the One True God." The meaning and fulfilment of this happy announcement became evident when Shaykh Salmán, the "Courier of the All-Merciful," arrived in Isfahán from the Holy Land, and informed the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs that the Ancient Beauty had commanded him to arrange for their niece, the daughter of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, to join the next pilgrimage caravan, and, having done so, to escort her to the Holy Land; for God had willed it that she should be betrothed to the Most Mighty Branch of God. Fátimih Khánum and Shaykh Salmán accordingly set out on their journey, travelling by way of Shíráz and Búshihr. In Shíráz, Fátimih Khánum met the respected Consort of His Holiness the Exalted One, the Khayru'n-Nisá' (Most Excellent of Women), Khadíjih Khánum; and, after she had enjoyed the bounty of association with that sore-tried and saintly Leaf, they pressed on their journey. Travelling by way of the Hijáz, they arrived first in Alexandria, and then in 'Akká. Pursuant to Bahá'u'lláh's command, she was entertained in the home of Mírzá Músáy-i-Kalím, where she remained a guest for five months. It was during this period that Fátimih Khánum received from the Tongue of Bahá'u'lláh the title "Munírih Khánum." Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alíy-i-Isfahání has also mentioned this utterance of the Blessed Beauty concerning Fátimih Khánum, which was recorded earlier, and made clear that after it had circulated among the friends, Fátimih Khánum became known as Munírih Khánum. At this point I shall interrupt the story of Munírih Khánum, and, in order to complete the sequence of historical events, set down a few words regarding Shahr-Bánú, to whom His Holiness the Most Mighty Branch was first betrothed, and the reason why the betrothal agreement did not come into effect.

Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan, the brother of the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- had a daughter named Shahr-Bánú. During the period ere His exile to Baghdád when the Ancient Beauty and the rest of His kindred were dwelling in Tihrán, it was decided that Shahr-Bánú, the daughter of Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan, should be betrothed to His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, and a promise and undertaking were given to this effect. In those days they were both still small, for in Írán it was customary for noble and genteel families to betroth their sons and daughters to one another from infancy. In due course the matter of the exile and banishment of the Holy Family from Tihrán to Baghdád and elsewhere supervened, and Shahr-Bánú stayed behind in Tihrán with her father and other family members. The elder sister of the Ancient Beauty on his father's side, who entertained the utmost hatred and enmity for the Ancient Beauty and the Holy Family, took the step in Tihrán of giving away Shahr-Bánú in wedlock to Mírzá 'Alí-Khán, the son of the Atábak, having first deceitfully won her trust by bringing her a quantity of gold, jewels, finest diamonds and the like treasures. Shahr-Bánú, who inwardly had no inclination for this unsuitable match, and had been induced to accept it under coercion, was so filled with grief and sorrow that she became consumptive a short while afterwards, and bade farewell to life.

His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- provides in His Tablet to Shaykh Qumí the following account of Shahr-Bánú, her taking ill of consumption, and her subsequent death.

*His most sweet utterance:*

... One of my female cousins on my father's side was, at the wish of Bahá'u'lláh, betrothed from a tender age to this servant. After we arrived in Baghdád, my honoured paternal uncle hastened unto the Holy Court, tearfully imploring that this connection be confirmed and ratified. This servant was not at first disposed to consent; but, in the end I bowed to the positive command of the Blessed Beauty, whilst ever wishing to remain single. So the matter stood until we arrived in Adrianople; and it was while we were here that Khánum Buzurg, my paternal aunt, who had a connection with Yahyá, merely that she might please him made it the object of her endeavour to give that poor maid away to Mírzá 'Alí Khán, the son of the Grand Vizir, which she successfully brought about. As was later related, she left her home in tears, fearful and trembling; nor did very many days pass ere she was afflicted with consumption, and died of that malady. May the mercy of God rest upon her ... *Finis*.

By the "honoured paternal uncle" mentioned in this Holy Tablet is intended Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan, the brother of the Blessed Beauty, to whom, in this connection, allusion is made by the Pen of the Most High towards the end of the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf. According to Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alíy-i-Isfahání, the name of that maid was Shahr-Bánú. Let us now turn to relating the sequel of the account of her Holiness Munírih Khánum, the respected Consort of 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- upon her be the Glory of God. After she had tarried five months in the house of his honour Áqáy-i-Kalím, it was eventually decided that their wedding would be held in the House of 'Abbúd. Her Holiness the Greatest Holy Leaf, Bahá'íyyih Khánum, prepared for the bride a white robe, wherewith she arrayed her form. The Holy Consort of the Blessed Beauty, the Mother of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, led Munírih Khánum to the Blessed Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- and she was honoured to come into His presence. Thus did Bahá'u'lláh address the bride: "O My Leaf! O My maidservant! We have chosen and accepted thee for the service of My Most Mighty Branch. This is a token of My Grace, wherewith the treasures of heaven and earth can never be compared ... how many the maidservants -- whether in Baghdád, Adrianople or this Most Great Prison -- who cherished the hope of winning this favour, yet was it not granted them! It behoveth thee to render thanks that thou hast attained unto this most great bounty and favour..." That night a celebratory gathering was held, at which special Tablets were read out. Nabíl-i-Zarandí has many verses on the subject of this fortune-favoured union -- among them the following ode, which he both composed and recited on that blessed night:

> Hail lovers! Joy! The world is like unto a rose garden ... tonight!
>
> With cypress and lily the feast of lovers is bedecked ... tonight!
>
> All things are singing songs of love; all atoms are astir with life:
>
> Thou too O heart vibrate with love, for joyous is the dance ... tonight!
>
> The time for fragrant breaths is come; the time for garden bower to sigh:
>
> For here of hyacinth and rose a myriad blooms are reaped ... tonight!
>
> Behold, the wedding feast hath come! The time to greet the friends is come!
>
> The eyes of the company of Bahá are bright with joy ... tonight!

> Behold the cups of gladness drained! behold the nodding flowers kiss!
>
> For by this joy-enhancing tale, the world's attired anew ... tonight!

From this union there resulted eight children, of whom four died in infancy: namely:

Husayn (His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá has said of Husayn: "Children are a tremendous source of delight and solace. I had a son, Husayn Effendi. When he was three or four years old, he used softly to steal into my bed while I was asleep. It had an indescribable savour." *Finis*. ('Abdu'l-Bahá's Travelogue). This Husayn Effendi is the same who as an infant pronounced the letter "Mím" as "Bá'," causing him to enunciate the word "*tamáshá*" as "*tabáshá*." After his passing, a Blessed Tablet was revealed in which Bahá'u'lláh represented the word "*tamáshá*," according to the child's pronunciation, as "*tabáshá*."

Mihdí.

Fu'ádíyyih.

Rúh-Angíz.

Four other daughters, having reached the years of discretion and maturity, chose husbands for themselves, and in due course produced children and grandchildren; their names are as follows:

Díyá'íyyih, who married Mírzá Hádí Afnán-i-Shírází, son of Áqá Siyyid Husayn, son of Hájí Siyyid Abu'l-Qásim Afnán, known as Saqqá-Kháni'í, son of Áqá Mírzá 'Alí, son of Mírzá 'Ábid. A lustrous bloom resulted from this union in the sacred person of his Holiness Shoghi Rabbání, Guardian of the Cause of God, the Chosen Branch of God, exalted be his sovereignty (1275-1336 A.H.S.; 1897-1957 A.D.), who, after the passing of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, was, according to the explicit pronouncement of His Will and Testament, established upon the seat of the Most Great Guardianship, and of the Interpretation of the Verses of the Most Mighty and All-Glorious Lord; whereat, pursuant to His promise, East and West were illumined by the lights of his peerless beauty; and the Cause of God enveloped the whole earth. In the year 1937 A.D. he was united in wedlock to the daughter of Mr. Maxwell, her honour Rúhíyyih Khánum, who through the intercession of 'Abdu'l-Bahá was born in 1910 A.D., and was the object of many signal favours.

Another daughter of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá was her honour Rúhá, who became the wife of Mírzá Jalál, the son of his honour the King of Martyrs.

Another of His daughters was Túbá, who became the wife of Mírzá Muhsin.

The last of His daughters was Munavvar, who was joined in wedlock to Mírzá Ahmad-i-Yazdí.

Briefly, Munírih Khánum lingered on for a while in this world after the passing of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, all the while seared and consumed with anguish on account of her separation from the beauteous figure of the Centre of the Covenant; until in the year 1313 A.H.S. that virtuous lady ascended in Haifa to the Abhá Kingdom, and at the sacred behest of his Honour the Guardian of the Cause of God, Shoghi Rabbání -- exalted be his sovereignty -- her mortal remains were interred on Mount Carmel, and a dignified monumental edifice was erected over her resting-place.

The biographical account of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, his children and grandchildren, here comes to an end. There is extant a letter which her Holiness Táhirih wrote to Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí from Karbilá. Although the copy of this letter available to me is marred by numerous errors, I shall venture in what follows to cite from it a few sentences in order to enhance the benefit of this narration.

Before setting down the utterances of Táhirih, however, I should like to provide a word of introduction. In this letter occurs the following sentence:

"Do thou return unto the Land of Sád, and warn thy brother of the greatness of the Judgment of Him Who is the Lord of all mankind." By this "brother," whom she instructs the recipient to apprise of the "greatness of the judgment," is intended Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, who was not at first a believer in the Blessed Cause. The reason why he invited His Holiness the Exalted One to his home was that the Báb was then the guest of Mír Siyyid Muhammad, the Sultánu'l-'Ulamá -- that is, the Imám-Jum'ih -- for whom Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím worked as overseer: in order, therefore, that he might honour the Imám's guest, he appointed the Báb a certain night on which he invited Him to visit him in his home. Briefly, Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, after the death of his first wife, Khánum Ján, married the wife of his deceased brother, Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, who was named Khurshíd Begum, but given the title "Shamsu'd-Duhá;" while he also joined his late brother's daughter in wedlock to his own distinguished son, Áqá Mírzá Hasan, the King of Martyrs. Although, before his marriage to Khurshíd Begum, Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím had been to a degree acquainted with the Cause of God, yet was he not included in the circle of the believers. After his marriage to Shamsu'd-Duhá, however, he was moved through association with that believing leaf, convinced as she was of the truth of the Blessed Cause, to embrace it, and thereafter to become settled in his own belief and conviction. Numerous Blessed Tablets were revealed in his honour by the Pen of the Ancient Beauty, transcriptions of some of which are included in the sixth section of this book.

I now proceed to set forth a portion of the letter of her Holiness Táhirih.

*Her utterance, upon her be the Glory of God:*

... O my kind brother, and my true master! My condition is not hid from thee, for thou hast been illumined with the light of faith, and lookest upon the beauteous countenance of the Author of the Bayán. My master! Do thou pray unto thy Lord, and make entreaty unto Him: haply He may bring about thereafter some change whereby we may be enabled to join our Master -- may the spirit of all that dwell in the Kingdom of Names and Attributes be a sacrifice unto His beauteous countenance. Alas, alas! And again alas, alas! And so again, for as long as it may please my Lord! O the grief and the pity of it, that I have failed in my duty towards God! By my father and my mother do I adjure thee, my master, O thou who conjoinest the Twin Names (Muhammad-'Alí) and revealest the Twin Symbols! Do thou return unto the Land of Sád, and warn thy brother of the greatness of the Judgment of Him Who is the Lord of all mankind. Announce unto them the Judgment of God; and make known unto them the Cause of God. Then whoso wisheth, let him believe; and whoso wisheth, let him disbelieve. By the might of my Lord! This warning is naught but a quintessential bounty: for were my Lord to send down fire, and burn us on the instant, it would be but our just desert, inasmuch as we have changed the goodly nature He implanted in us; have charged with falsehood Him Who is the Proof of God; and have differed amongst ourselves, even after He made us a single people and a single faith. Gracious God! Do thou warn them, O my lord, and admonish them, O my master. Yea, by the Lord! God, the True One, is possessed of grace abounding. The decree, verily, hath been fulfilled, and all are commanded to set out, and to delay not, though it be for a single moment. Admonish them, O my lord, to look unto the Book of God, which neither vanity can reach, nor idleness approach. If any be wrongfully slain, we have granted his guardian authority over the assailant; yet let him not slay to excess: he, verily, shall be victoriously assisted. And remove the veil from their eyes... etc.

*Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí*

This blessed personage also was the son of Hájj Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Nahrí, as well as the esteemed brother of Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí. He was born in Isfahán, where he was known for being God-fearing, religiously observant, and reclusive. The divines of the city as a whole did not stint him any form of respect. He enjoyed the confidence of all the spiritual leaders. In particular, the late Siyyid Muhammad-Báqir-i-Shaftí, Hujjatu'l-Islám, who was mentioned in the preceding, evinced towards Áqá Mírzá Hádí the utmost love and kindness -- entertained indeed for him such love and affection that he gave him to wife his cousin on his father's side, Khurshíd Begum, a girl who was educated, sagacious, pious, and accomplished in all respects. Subsequent to this event, Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí tarried for some while in Isfahán, and thereafter removed with his family from Isfahán to the Sacred Thresholds, choosing Karbilá as his home. Whilst there he used to accompany his brother, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, who in those days was also resident in Karbilá, into the presence of Hájí Siyyid Kázim-i-Rashtí, and benefit from the illimitable knowledge and learning of that illustrious figure. These two brothers and their families became known in Karbilá for their devotion to the Shaykh and the Siyyid, and were counted among the leading lights of the Shaykhí school. As was mentioned in the account of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, on several occasions during this period the two brothers met in the sacred precincts of the shrine of His Holiness the Prince of Martyrs -- peace be upon Him -- His Holiness the Primal Point -- glorified be His mention -- Who was at that epoch hidden behind seventy thousand veils of light, and conceived for Him in their hearts the strongest affection. Many a time Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí remarked to his brother Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí, "Mine heart attesteth that this young Siyyid is the Proof of the Era and the Lord of the Age!" More than anything, it was the wrapt and undivided attention, the peerless and unexampled humility and lowliness so conspicuously evident in the demeanour of His Holiness the Exalted One during His visits to the illumined resting-place of the King of Martyrs -- peace be upon Him; also the extraordinary reverence Siyyid-i-Rashtí observed towards Him, that attracted the gaze of those two discerning brothers towards the Point of Truth. When in due course the Divine Call was raised from Shíráz, Áqá Mírzá Hádí observed to his brother, "Methinks the author of this claim is that same Shírází youth whom we saw aforetime in Karbilá." The two brothers accordingly set off for Shíráz in order to investigate the matter. They arrived after the Báb had already departed on His pilgrimage to the Holy Kaaba; but as fate had it, they chanced to meet there Mullá Husayn-i-Bushrú'í, and, through the guidance of that wellspring of faith and purity, attained to recognition of the Divine Point. Thereafter they, together with a number of the companions including Mullá Husayn, journeyed to Isfahán, and thence to Shíráz, where, as previously mentioned, they benefited for a period, according as circumstances permitted, from His holy presence, before leaving Shíráz at His bidding following the grave disturbances in the city. Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí proceeded, as previously related, to Isfahán, while Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí for his part returned to Karbilá, whence he removed after some time to Isfahán. Subsequent to the Báb's arrival from Shíráz in Isfahán, he enjoyed on numerous occasions the bounty of meeting the Beloved of the World. Later, when His Holiness the Exalted One -- glorified be His most exalted mention -- was incarcerated in the prison of Máh-Kú, Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, his yearning to gaze upon the beauteous countenance of the Manifestation of God overcoming all patience and restraint, set out for Máh-Kú in order to attain His blessed presence; then, having accomplished his desire, he set off anew for Isfahán. Khurshíd Begum, the wife of Áqá Mírzá Hádí, had tarried all this while in Karbilá, where she received an ample portion from the ocean of the knowledge and wisdom of Siyyid-i-Rashtí, and garnered for herself inestimable benefits. After the death of Siyyid-i-Rashtí, which occurred on the Day of 'Arafih (9 Dhi'l-Hijjih) of the year 1259 in Karbilá, Khurshíd Begum sought seclusion in the house of her Holiness Táhirih, Qurratu'l-'Ayn, who was at that time resident in Karbilá, and, profiting from the abundant grace that had fallen to her lot, quaffed a sufficient draft from the camphor cup of mystic truths. Among the friends, she became known by the title "Shamsu'd-Duhá;" and, through association with her Holiness Táhirih, arrived at the highest level of knowledge and certitude, drawing forth the winning arrow. It chanced one day that, at the instigation of hostile elements, certain vile and abject persons launched an assault upon the house of her Holiness Táhirih, and mistakenly seizing Shamsu'd-Duhá instead of Táhirih, inflicted upon her grievous injury and harm, even stoning her. In brief, Shamsu'd-Duhá accompanied her Holiness Táhirih wherever she went, and continued to do so up to the time of her arrival in Qazvín. Here her husband Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, who chanced to arrive in the city at the same time on his way back from Máh-Kú to Isfahán, learning of their arrival there, bore her with him to Isfahán. We shall return again hereafter to the story of Shamsu'd-Duhá. To resume, Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí and his brother, after hearing the blessed command of His Holiness the Exalted One "Hasten to the Land of Khá'!," set out, as previously related, for Mashhad, participating *en route* in the Conference of Badasht. At the close of proceedings, they departed with a group of the companions for Mázindarán. As fate had it, they were subjected, upon arriving in Níyálá, to a vicious onslaught by a band of men from the village of Hizár-Jaríb in Mázindarán, who inflicted grievous injury and harm upon a number of the companions, including Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí. After sustaining unnumbered blows, the two Nahrí brothers sought refuge in a ruined building off the beaten track, where Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí yielded up his spirit. The explanation of this event and the manner of its occurrence are more precisely as follows. After the conclusion of the Conference of Badasht, the Báb's disciples set out for Mázindarán. The Blessed Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- gave order for a howdah, and when this was procured, Quddús took a seat on one side and Táhirih on the other. Each day Táhirih composed beautiful odes and stirring, soul-uplifting verses, which the companions walking beside the howdah recited with extraordinary zest and enthusiasm. They traversed the way in a singular state of happiness and exhilaration, dancing, carefree, joyous and enthusiastic, until they reached the village of Níyálá. Here, after spending the night at the foot of a mountain, they were of a sudden fallen upon at daybreak by a group of men from Hizár-Jaríb. The cause of this unexpected assault was partly the intense hatred and enmity, fostered by the doctors and divines, which these men harboured for the companions; partly the preposterous calumnies and outlandish accusations they had heard the people uttering against them, leading them to imagine them worthy of death and destruction; and partly also the strange fear and dread of the Bábís that had taken root in their hearts, inducing them, by way of forestalling an anticipated evil, to launch upon the companions a surprise attack, so that they might at once be rid of the fear of them, and, through massacring them and plundering their wealth, win for themselves a great reward. More particularly, the manifestations of fervour, enthusiasm, joy and jubilation evinced by the companions on the eve of their arrival at the foot of the mountain had kindled in the hearts of those ignorant men a fierce animosity; while the incitement of the 'ulamá and instigation of the religious leaders had further disposed the churlish band to deem them worthy of assault. In fine, these various reasons and causes all combined, with the result that the companions found themselves the objects of attack. Armed with sticks and stones, and other tools and instruments of war and battery, the men of Hizár-Jaríb dealt the companions countless blows, and inflicted upon them incalculable injury and harm. A number of them were wounded, and much of their property was seized as plunder. Since the companions had previously felt in all respects at ease about the place, never expecting so violent an assault and incursion, they were caught completely off their guard, and, powerless to offer resistance, were scattered abroad, each one making off in a different direction. His holiness Quddús headed for Mázindarán. In the midst of all the commotion, while everyone was fleeing to a different quarter, Táhirih remained alone and unprotected. Wishing to defend her, one of the companions, a youth named Mírzá 'Abdu'lláh-i-Shírází, stepped into the arena of sacrifice, unsheathed his sword, and was about to set upon the assailants, when the Blessed Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- bade him refrain from assault and slaughter, and, Himself taking a stance before the attackers, induced them, through effective admonitions and counsels, and unnumbered exhortations and advices, to stay their offensive. "Who is your chief?" He asked them; to which they replied, "Daryá-Bigí is our chief." "I am acquainted with him," Bahá'u'lláh replied, "We have known each other for some time." A number of them then went off to inform Daryá-Bigí, who no sooner heard the name Bahá'u'lláh than he came into His presence, and made profession of his servitude and sincere attachment. The Blessed Beauty requested him to hold back the men from their incursion and assault, and to recover from the assailants, and make restitution of, the property they had looted and plundered. Forthwith executing Bahá'u'lláh's command, Daryá-Bigí recovered from the men all the looted property, and restored it to its owners. The Blessed Beauty commanded that her Holiness Táhirih set out for the district of Núr, travelling by way of Bárfurúsh (which is in these days known as Bábul). Appointing a house and dwelling-place for her abode, Bahá'u'lláh directed Mullá Abú-Turáb-i-Ishtihárdí, who was also present, to convey her to Núr, and there to lodge her in the appointed premises. To resume the account: among the companions who were grievously afflicted in that fearful encounter, receiving numerous wounds and injuries from the fell band of assailants, was Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí. His distinguished brother Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí relates the event as follows: "When this group of rabble and herd of assailants descended upon the faithful companions in Níyálá, bearing off everyone's property and effects as booty and plunder, each one of the companions made off in a separate direction. My brother, Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, and I too struck out with several other people along a particular route. My brother, Áqá Mírzá Hádí, who had suffered grievous hurt, and received many wounds, was overcome by faintness along the way, and in the extremity of his weakness lost all power of endurance. By sheer force of necessity, we managed by some means to reach a derelict and dilapidated caravanserai, where we took shelter. My brother Áqá Mírzá Hádí passed away the same night in that ruined caravanserai, finding deliverance from the hardships of this world. A number of the companions who had been accompanying me, fearing the assault of the enemy, took flight in the middle of the night, and I was left alone, revolving what to do, and to whom to turn for help in burying my brother. At daybreak I removed my brother's body from the caravanserai, and laid it beside the highway, hoping that someone might arrive who could assist me in this office. I fastened my eyes upon the road, and after an hour a cloud of dust arose in the distance, announcing the approach of a traveller. I waited to see who it might be, at length espying, as the figure drew nearer, that it was a woman. When she arrived she asked, 'Who art thou, and what dost thou here?' I replied, 'I am a stranger in these parts. Last night my brother passed away in this caravanserai, and I am looking for someone to assist me in burying his corse.' 'Be comforted,' the woman replied, 'I shall even now myself assist thee in this task: in sooth, 'twas for this purpose that I came hither.' 'How couldst thou have known what hath here chanced?' I asked; to which she answered, 'Last night that embodiment of saintly purity, Her Holiness Fátimih the Radiant -- may God's peace rest upon Her -- appeared to me in a dream, and addressed me saying: "One of my children hath passed away, forlorn and far from home, in this vicinity: do thou go at once and bury him with fullest dignity and honour." As bidden by that illustrious figure, I immediately set out, and lo! find now the object of my quest; and yield thanks unto God for having granted me this bestowal.' She then set off for the village, and presently returned, bringing with her a company of helpers to perform the rites of shrouding and interment. Having washed my brother in a stream, they wrapped him in a winding-sheet; and since he had repeatedly said, 'Should I die, be sure to bury me on a way frequented by the pilgrims to Karbilá,' we therefore interred him in that same place, which lay on just such a road." This was the essence of what Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí related to his friends and relatives after his return to Isfahán. From Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí and his esteemed consort Khurshíd Begum, styled "Shamsu'd-Duhá," there remained one son and one daughter. Their son, who was named Siyyid 'Alí, married his cousin Rádíyih Begum, the daughter of his paternal uncle Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, and from this union resulted a son named Mírzá 'Ináyatu'lláh, who still survives; is nowadays resident in Haifa; remains firm in the Cause and unassailable Divine Covenant; and has children of his own. As for the daughter of Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, who was named Fátimih Begum, she was honoured to be joined in wedlock to Áqá Mírzá Hasan, the King of Martyrs -- upon him be the Glory of God -- and from this union there resulted a number of offspring, to whom reference will be made in the biographical notice and circumstantial account of the King of Martyrs. An account of Fátimih Begum, the daughter of Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí and Shamsu'd-Duhá, and the respected consort of his honour the King of Martyrs, has been bequeathed by the pen of 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- in the work *Memorials of the Faithful*, the which I now take opportunity to set forth.

*His most sweet utterance:*

*The Consort of his Honour the King of Martyrs*

Among the women who came out of their homeland was the sorrowing Fátimih Begum, widow of the King of Martyrs. She was a holy leaf of the Tree of God. From her earliest youth she was beset with uncounted ordeals. First was the disaster which overtook her noble father in the environs of Badasht, when, after terrible suffering, he died in a desert caravanserai, died hard -- helpless and far from home. // The child was left an orphan, and in distress, until, by God's grace, she became the wife of the King of Martyrs. But since he was known everywhere as a Bahá'í, was an impassioned lover of Bahá'u'lláh, a man distracted, carried away, and since Násiri'd-Dín Sháh thirsted for blood -- the hostile lurked in their ambush, and every day they informed against him and slandered him afresh, started a new outcry and set new mischief afoot. For this reason his family was never sure of his safety for a single day, but lived from moment to moment in anguish, foreseeing and dreading the hour of his martyrdom. Here was the family, everywhere known as Bahá'ís; their enemies, stony-hearted tyrants; their government inflexibly, permanently against them; their reigning Sovereign rabid for blood. // It is obvious how life would be for such a household. Every day there was a new incident, more turmoil, another uproar, and they could not draw a breath in peace. Then, he was martyred. The Government proved brutal and savage to such a degree that the human race cried out and trembled. All his possessions were stripped away and plundered, and his family lacked even their daily bread. // Fátimih spent her nights in weeping; till dawn broke, her only companions were tears. Whenever she gazed on her children, she would sigh, wearing away like a candle in devouring grief. But then she would thank God, and she would say: "Praised be the Lord, these agonies, these broken fortunes are on Bahá'u'lláh's account, for His dear sake." She would call to mind the defenceless family of the martyred Husayn, and what calamities they were privileged to bear in the pathway of God. And as she pondered those events, her heart would leap up, and she would cry, "Praise be to God! We too have become companions of the Prophet's Household." // Because the family was in such straits, Bahá'u'lláh directed them to come to the Most Great Prison so that, sheltered in these precincts of abounding grace, they might be compensated for all that had passed. Here for a time she lived, joyful, thankful, and praising God. And although the son of the King of Martyrs, Mírzá Abdu'l-Husayn, died in the prison, still his mother, Fátimih, accepted this, resigned herself to the Will of God, did not so much as sigh or cry out, and did not go into mourning. Not a word did she utter to bespeak her grief. // This handmaid of God was infinitely patient, dignified and reserved, and at all times thankful. But then Bahá'u'lláh left the world, and this was the supreme affliction, the ultimate anguish, and she could endure no more. The shock and alarm were such that like a fish taken from the water she writhed on the ground, trembled and shook as if her whole being quaked, until at last she took leave of her children and she died. She rose up into the shadowing mercy of God and was plunged in an ocean of light. Unto her be salutations and praise, compassion and glory. May God make sweet her resting-place with the outpourings of His heavenly mercy; in the shade of the Divine Lote Tree may He honour her dwelling.

*Khurshíd Begum "Shamsu'd-Duhá"*

Now that the story of the life of Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí has reached its conclusion, an account should be given of his respected consort. To this end I set forth the description which His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His sovereignty -- has provided concerning that beatific leaf in His work *Memorials of the Faithful*.

*His most sweet utterance:*

Khurshíd Begum, who was given the title of "Shamsu'd-Duhá," was mother-in-law to the King of Martyrs. This eloquent, ardent handmaid of God was the cousin on her father's side of the famous Muhammad-Báqir of Isfahán, widely celebrated as chief of the 'ulamás in that city. When still a child she lost both her parents, and was reared by her grandmother in the home of that famed and learned mujtahid, and well trained in various branches of knowledge, in theology, sciences and the arts. // Once she was grown, she was married to Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí; and since she and her husband were both strongly attracted to the mystical teachings of that great luminary, the excellent and distinguished Siyyid Kázim-i-Rashtí, they left for Karbilá, accompanied by Mírzá Hádí's brother, Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí. Here they used to attend the Siyyid's classes, imbibing his knowledge, so that this handmaid became thoroughly informed on subjects relating to Divinity, on the Scriptures and on their inner meanings. The couple had two children, a girl and a boy. They called their son Siyyid 'Alí and their daughter Fátimih Begum, she being the one who, when she reached adolescence, was married to the King of Martyrs. // Shamsu'd-Duhá was there in Karbilá when the cry of the Exalted Lord was raised in Shíráz, and she shouted back, "Yea, verily!" As for her husband and his brother, they immediately set out for Shíráz; for both of them, when visiting the Shrine of the Imám Husayn, had looked upon the beauty of the Primal Point, the Báb; both had been astonished at what they saw in that transplendent Face, in those heavenly attributes and ways, and had agreed that One such as this must indeed be some very great being. Accordingly, the moment they learned of His Divine summons, they answered: "Yea, verily!" and they burst into flame with yearning love for God. Besides, they had been present every day in that holy place where the late Siyyid taught, and had clearly heard him say: "The Advent is nigh, the affair most subtle, most elusive. It behoves each one to search, to inquire, for it may be that the Promised One is even now present among men, even now visible, while all about Him are heedless, unmindful, with bandaged eyes, even as the sacred Traditions have foretold." // When the two brothers arrived in Persia they heard that the Báb had gone to Mecca on a pilgrimage. Siyyid Muhammad-'Alí therefore left for Isfahán and Mírzá Hádí returned to Karbilá. Meanwhile Shamsu'd-Duhá had become friends with the "Leaf of Paradise," sister to Mullá Husayn, the Bábu'l-Báb. Through that lady she had met Táhirih, Qurratu'l-'Ayn, and had begun to spend most of her time in close companionship with them both, occupied in teaching the Faith. Since this was in the early days of the Cause, the people were not yet afraid of it. From being with Táhirih, Shamsu'd-Duhá profited immeasurably, and was more on fire with the Faith than ever. She spent three years in close association with Táhirih in Karbilá. Day and night, she was stirred like the sea by the gales of the All-Merciful, and she taught with an eloquent tongue. // As Táhirih became celebrated throughout Karbilá, and the Cause of His Supreme Holiness, the Báb, spread all over Persia, the latter-day 'ulamás arose to deny, to heap scorn upon, and to destroy it. They issued a fatvá or judgment that called for a general massacre. Táhirih was one of those designated by the evil 'ulamás of the city as an unbeliever, and they mistakenly thought her to be in the home of Shamsu'd-Duhá. They broke into Shamsu'd-Duhá's house, hemmed her in, abused and vilified her, and inflicted grievous bodily harm. They dragged her out of the house and through the streets to the bazaar; they beat her with clubs; they stoned her, they denounced her in foul language, repeatedly assaulting her. While this was going on, Hájí Siyyid Mihdí, the father of her distinguished husband, reached the scene. "This woman is not Táhirih!" he shouted at them. But he had no witness to prove it, and the farráshes, the police and the mob would not let up. Then, through the uproar, a voice screamed out: "They have arrested Qurratu'l-'Ayn!" At this, the people abandoned Shamsu'd-Duhá. // Guards were placed at the door of Táhirih's house and no one was allowed to enter or leave, while the authorities waited for instructions from Baghdád and Constantinople. As the interval of waiting lengthened out, Táhirih asked for permission to leave for Baghdád. "Let us go there ourselves," she told them. "We are resigned to everything. Whatever happens to us is the best that can happen, and the most pleasing." With government permission, Táhirih, the Leaf of Paradise, her mother and Shamsu'd-Duhá all left Karbilá and travelled to Baghdád, but the snake-like mass of the populace followed them for some distance, stoning them from a little way off. // When they reached Baghdád they went to live at the house of Shaykh Muhammad-i-Shibl, the father of Muhammad-Mustafá; and since many crowded the doors there was an uproar throughout that quarter, so that Táhirih transferred her residence elsewhere, to a lodging of her own, where she continually taught the Faith, and proclaimed the Word of God. Here the 'ulamás, shaykhs and others would come to listen to her, asking their questions and receiving her replies, and she was soon remarkably well known throughout Baghdád, expounding as she would the most recondite and subtle of theological themes. // When word of this reached the government authorities, they conveyed Táhirih, Shamsu'd-Duhá and the Leaf of Paradise to the house of the Muftí and here they remained three months until word as to their case was received from Constantinople. During Táhirih's stay at the Muftí's, much of the time was spent in conversations with him, in producing convincing proofs as to the Teachings, analysing and expounding questions relative to the Lord God, discoursing on the Resurrection Day, on the Balance and the Reckoning, unravelling the complexities of inner truths. // One day the Muftí's father came in and belaboured them violently and at length. This somewhat discomfited the Muftí and he began to apologize for his father. Then he said: "Your answer has arrived from Constantinople. The Sovereign has set you free, but on condition that you quit his realms." The next morning they left the Muftí's house and proceeded to the public baths. Meanwhile Shaykh Muhammad-i-Shibl and Shaykh Sultán-i-'Arab made the necessary preparations for their journey, and when three days had passed, they left Baghdád; that is, Táhirih, Shamsu'd-Duhá, the Leaf of Paradise, the mother of Mírzá Hádí, and a number of Siyyids from Yazd set out for Persia. Their travel expenses were all provided by Shaykh Muhammad. // They arrived at Kirmánsháh, where the women took up residence in one house, the men in another. The work of teaching went on at all times, and as soon as the 'ulamás became aware of it they ordered that the party be expelled. At this the district head, with a crowd of people, broke into the house and carried off their belongings; then they seated the travellers in open howdahs and drove them from the city. When they came to a field, the muleteers set them down on the bare ground and left, taking animals and howdahs away, leaving them without food or luggage, and with no roof over their heads. // Táhirih thereupon wrote a letter to the Governor of Kirmánsháh. "We were travellers," she wrote, "guests in your city. 'Honour thy guest,' the Prophet says, 'though he be an unbeliever.' Is it right that a guest should be thus scorned and despoiled?" The Governor ordered that the stolen goods be restored, and that all be returned to the owners. Accordingly the muleteers came back as well, seated the travellers in the howdahs again, and they went on to Hamadán. The ladies of Hamadán, even the princesses, came every day to meet with Táhirih, who remained in that city two months. There she dismissed some of her travelling companions, so that they could return to Baghdád; others, however, accompanied her to Qazvín. // As they journeyed, some horsemen, kinsfolk of Táhirih's, that is, her brothers, approached. "We have come," they said, "at our father's command, to lead her away, alone." But Táhirih refused, and accordingly the whole party remained together until they arrived in Qazvín. Here, Táhirih went to her father's house, and the friends, those who had ridden and those who had travelled on foot, put up at a caravanserai. Mírzá Hádí, the husband of Shamsu'd-Duhá, had gone to Máh-Kú, seeking out the Báb. On his return, he awaited the arrival of Shamsu'd-Duhá in Qazvín, after which the couple left for Isfahán, and when they reached there, Mírzá Hádí journeyed on to Badasht. In that hamlet and its vicinity he was attacked, tormented, even stoned, and was subjected to such ordeals that finally, in a ruined caravanserai, he died. His brother, Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí, buried him there, along the roadside. // Shamsu'd-Duhá remained in Isfahán. She spent her days and nights in the remembrance of God and in teaching His Cause to the women of that city. She was gifted with an eloquent tongue; her utterance was wonderful to hear. She was highly honoured by the leading women of Isfahán, celebrated for piety, for godliness, and the purity of her life. She was chastity embodied; all her hours were spent in reciting Holy Writ, or expounding the Texts, or unravelling the most complex of spiritual themes, or spreading abroad the sweet savours of God. // It was for these reasons that the King of Martyrs married her respected daughter and became her son-in-law. And when Shamsu'd-Duhá went to live in his princely house, day and night the people thronged its doors, for the leading women of the city, whether friends or strangers, whether close to her or not, would come and go. For she was a fire lit by the love of God, and she proclaimed the Word of God with great ardour and verve, so that she became known among the non-believers as the "Fátimih the Radiant of the Bahá'ís." // And so time passed, until the day when the "She-Serpent" and the "Wolf" conspired together and issued a decree, a fatvá, that sentenced the King of Martyrs to death. They plotted as well with the Governor of the city so that among them they could sack and plunder and carry off all that vast treasure he possessed. Then the Sháh joined forces with those two wild animals; and he commanded that the blood of both brothers, the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, be spilled out. Without warning, those ruthless men: the She-Serpent, the Wolf, and their brutal farráshes and constabulary -- attacked; they chained the two brothers and led them off to prison, looted their richly furnished houses, wrested away all their possessions, and spared no one, not even infants at the breast. They tortured, cursed, reviled, mocked, beat the kin and others of the victims' household, and would not stay their hands. // In Paris, Zillu's-Sultán related the following, swearing to the truth of it upon his oath: "Many and many a time I warned those two great scions of the Prophet's House, but all to no avail. At the last I summoned them one night, and with extreme urgency I told them in so many words: 'Gentlemen, the Sháh has three times condemned you to death. His farmáns keep on coming. The decree is absolute and there is only one course open to you now: you must, in the presence of the 'ulamás, clear yourselves and curse your Faith.' Their answer was: 'Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá! May our lives be offered up!' Finally I agreed to their not cursing their Faith. I told them all they had to say was, 'We are not Bahá'ís.' 'Just those few words,' I said, 'will be enough; then I can write out my report for the Sháh, and you will be saved.' 'That is impossible,' they answered, 'because we are Bahá'ís. Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá! Our hearts hunger for martyrdom! Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!' I was enraged, then, and I tried, by being harsh with them, to force them to renounce their Faith, but it was hopeless. The decree of the rapacious She-Serpent and Wolf, and the Sháh's commands, were carried out." // After those two were martyred, Shamsu'd-Duhá was hunted down, and had to seek a refuge in her brother's house. Although he was not a believer, he was known in Isfahán as an upright, pious and godly man, a man of learning, an ascetic who, hermit-like, kept to himself, and for these reasons he was highly regarded and trusted by all. She stayed there with him, but the Government did not abandon its search, finally discovered her whereabouts and summoned her to appear; the evil 'ulamás had a hand in this, joining forces with the civil authorities. Her brother was therefore obliged to accompany Shamsu'd-Duhá to the Governor's house. He remained without, while they sent his sister into the women's apartments; the Governor came there, to the door, and he kicked and trampled her so savagely that she fainted away. Then the Governor shouted to his wife: "Princess! Princess! Come here and take a look at the 'Fátimih the Radiant of the Bahá'ís!'" // The women lifted her up and put her in one of the rooms. Meanwhile her brother, dumbfounded, was waiting outside the mansion. Finally, trying to plead with him, he said to the Governor: "This sister of mine has been beaten so severely that she is at the point of death. What is the use of keeping her here? There is no hope for her now. With your permission I can get her back to my house. It would be better to have her die there, rather than here, for after all, she is a descendant of the Prophet, she is of Muhammad's noble line, and she has done no wrong. There is nothing against her except her kinship to the son-in-law." The Governor answered: "She is one of the great leaders and heroines of the Bahá'ís. She will simply cause another uproar." The brother said: "I promise you that she will not utter a word. It is certain that within a few days she will not even be alive. Her body is frail, weak, almost lifeless, and she has suffered terrible harm." // Since the brother was greatly respected and trusted by high and low alike, the Governor released Shamsu'd-Duhá in his custody, letting her go. She lived for a while in his house, crying out, grieving, shedding her tears, mourning her dead. Neither was the brother at peace, nor would the hostile leave them alone; there was some new turmoil every day, and public clamour. The brother finally thought it best to take Shamsu'd-Duhá away on a pilgrimage to Mashhad, hoping that the fire of civil disturbances would die down. // They went to Mashhad and settled in a vacant house near the Shrine of the Imám Ridá. // Because he was such a pious man the brother would leave every morning to visit the Shrine, and there he would stay, busy with his devotions until almost noon. In the afternoon as well, he would hasten away to the Holy Place, and pray until evening. The house being empty, Shamsu'd-Duhá managed to get in touch with various women believers and began to associate with them; and because the love of God burned so brightly in her heart she was unable to keep silent, so that during those hours when her brother was absent the place came alive. The Bahá'í women would flock there and absorb her lucid and eloquent speech. // In those days life in Mashhad was hard for the believers, with the malevolent always on the alert; if they so much as suspected an individual, they murdered him. There was no security of any kind, no peace. But Shamsu'd-Duhá could not help herself: in spite of all the terrible ordeals she had endured, she ignored the danger, and was capable of flinging herself into flames, or into the sea. Since her brother frequented no one, he knew nothing of what was going on. Day and night he would only leave the house for the Shrine, the Shrine for the house; he was a recluse, had no friends, and would not so much as speak to another person. Nevertheless there came a day when he saw that trouble had broken out in the city, and he knew it would end in serious harm. He was a man so calm and silent that he did not reproach his sister; he simply took her away from Mashhad without warning, and they returned to Isfahán. Here, he sent her to her daughter, the widow of the King of Martyrs, for he would no longer shelter her under his roof. // Shamsu'd-Duhá was thus back in Isfahán, boldly teaching the Faith and spreading abroad the sweet savours of God. So vehement was the fiery love in her heart that it compelled her to speak out, whenever she found a listening ear. And when it was observed that once again the household of the King of Martyrs was about to be overtaken by calamities, and that they were enduring severe afflictions there in Isfahán, Bahá'u'lláh desired them to come to the Most Great Prison. Shamsu'd-Duhá, with the widow of the King of Martyrs and the children, arrived in the Holy Land. Here they were joyously spending their days when the son of the King of Martyrs, Mírzá Abdu'l-Husayn, as a result of the awful suffering he had been subjected to in Isfahán, came down with tuberculosis and died in 'Akká. // Shamsu'd-Duhá was heavy of heart. She mourned his absence, she wasted away with longing for him, and it was all much harder because then the Supreme Affliction came upon us, the crowning anguish. The basis of her life was undermined; candle-like, she was consumed with grieving. She grew so feeble that she took to her bed, unable to move. Still, she did not rest, nor keep silent for a moment. She would tell of days long gone, of things that had come to pass in the Cause, or she would recite from Holy Writ, or she would supplicate, and chant her prayers -- until, out of the Most Great Prison, she soared away to the world of God. She hastened away from this dust gulf of perdition to an unsullied country; packed her gear and journeyed to the land of lights. Unto her be salutations and praise, and most great mercy, sheltered in the compassion of her omnipotent Lord. *Finis*.

Of the Twin Shining Lights

The Children and Grandchildren of Each

*Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím ***

The other son of Hájí Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Nahrí was named Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím. He ranked among the notables of Isfahán, and was held in the highest esteem by the Imám-Jum'ih, the government, and all other dignitaries. God bestowed upon him numerous offspring; to whit: four sons and a daughter, of whom notice will be taken later in these pages. The most famous of them were Áqá Mírzá Husayn (the Beloved of Martyrs), and Áqá Mírzá Hasan (the King of Martyrs), who in faith and certitude are peerless and unparalleled; who in self-sacrifice and detachment are unexampled; who in the sight of the incomparable God are accounted as among the near ones; and who within the pale of the Blessed Cause are possessed of a lofty rank and an exalted degree. Numerous Tablets revealed by the Pen of the Blessed Beauty in honour of these two high-born brothers attest their exalted station, and the favour they enjoy in the Court of Him Who is the King, the All-Knowing. I shall now provide a short account of each of these twin blissful, brilliant lights, after which I shall relate in detail the story of their martyrdom.

*Áqá Mírzá Husayn, The Beloved of Martyrs*

As mentioned, this illustrious figure, who was born in the year 1251 A.H., was the august scion of Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, the son of Hájí Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Nahrí. His honour the Beloved of Martyrs was joined in wedlock to Fátimih Sultán Begum, and from this union resulted four children. After the passing of Fátimih Sultán Begum, a number of Tablets were revealed in her honour, two of which are as follows.

*Prayer for forgiveness revealed by the pen of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá for the consort of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs:*

* Alláh-u-Abhá! *

O my God! O my God! This is a leaf that was stirred by the breaths blowing from the meads of Thy Lordship; and this is a maidservant who was illumined by the lights that gleamed and shone forth from the horizon of Thy Divinity, and who believed in Thy beauty; accepted Thy words; sought the guidance of Thy Verses; and beheld Thy signs. She was related to a tree that sprang up in the garden of Thy knowledge; became verdant through the bounty of the cloud of Thy mercy; blossomed with the flowers of Thy bestowal; brought forth the fruits of Thy love; weathered every tempest, storm and hurricane in Thy path; and took root and grew strong in the meads of Thy kingdom, through Thy grace and loving-kindness. Thereafter this maidservant that was conjoined to him remained, O my God, abased and humiliated for love of Thee amidst a ferocious band of predatory creatures and ravening wolves, bearing every affliction, sustaining every hardship, and enduring a cruelty of treatment such that pens are powerless to describe it. All this, O my God, she suffered in Thy path and for love of Thee, until her days came to an end, her dreams came true, and she returned unto Thee; ended her journey within the borders of Thy kingdom; arrived at the gate of Thy heavenly dominion; and took refuge in the shelter of Thy mercy. O my Lord! Honour her last resting-place, that in the immortal Paradise the Maids of Holiness may celebrate her arrival, and in the Abhá Paradise the Vestals of Sanctified and Blissful Communion may extend to her a joyous welcome. Confer Thou patience and consolation upon her offspring, the apples of her eye, at whose grief and sorrow; distress and desolation; affliction, anguish and bereavement the eyes of the Concourse on High run down with tears. Thou, verily, art the All-Bountiful, the Most Merciful. 'Ayn 'Ayn

*Photograph of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, Áqá Mírzá Husayn*

* Alláh-u-Abhá! *

At the passing and ascension of that bird of the garden of certitude all hearts are sorrowful and afflicted; yet since that holy and spiritual leaf ascended from the vale of tears unto the apex of the loving-kindness of the Abhá Kingdom, and soared up from the darksome tribulations of this nether realm unto the illumined world of supernal happiness, all her offspring and relatives should be consoled. For, praise be to God, that tranquil leaf believed with perfect assurance in the Beauty of God; was serenely confident of His bounty; bore the most grievous tribulations in His pathway; and dwelt under the protection of a blessed soul through whom the kingdom of existence is bathed in light. Praise be to God too that she left behind her souls who are sheltered beneath the shadow of the Word of Divine Unity; who seek illumination from the Kingdom of Mercy; who are watched over by the Eye of Loving-kindness; and who are surrounded by the favours of the One True God. Upon you be His Glory. 'Ayn 'Ayn

*The Children of the Beloved of Martyrs*

1\) Fátimih Begum, who married a Muslim man named Áqá Mihdí Hájí Rasúl. When her illustrious father fell into the clutches of his enemies and the opponents of the Cause she suffered indescribable distress, succumbing, as a result of the innumerable calamities she witnessed, to a grievous malady. Her husband tended her throughout the course of a whole year, but finally, ere she was quite thirty, she passed away. Although her husband was a Muslim, he loved his wife unreservedly. In a Tablet addressed to him His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- states the following.

*His most sweet utterance:*

O thou whom God hath honoured through alliance to the Beloved of Martyrs! Favours are of two kinds: the first is expected, and the second is unexpected. Expected favours are such as are known of in advance; whereas unexpected favours are such as are vouchsafed without question or entreaty; with no prior knowledge or expectation; and purely through the loving-kindness and special favour of God. Now hath the One True God made thee, unwitting and inadvertent as thou wast, the loving son-in-law of a holy being through the brightness of whose radiant brow the horizon of Supreme Sacrifice is effulgent, and through the lamp of whose delightful countenance the glass of Surpassing Bounty is illumined. In the realm of the Abhá Kingdom the throne of his grandeur is established; and amidst the company of the Supreme Concourse he is crowned with a diadem of hallowed glory. From the beginning of maturity until the time when thou didst become a believer thou neither hadst any expectation of such a favour, nor realized that such a bounty had fallen to thy lot. Therefore must thou appreciate with heart and soul the value of these bestowals, and yield with every breath a hundred thousand thanks. Since that leaf who hath drawn nigh unto the Court of Oneness hath suffered divers shocks that are beyond the power of human endurance, and in consequence whereof her physical temple hath been overcome by weakness, thou must ever provide such means as shall conduce to her peace and tranquillity, so that she may at least be in some sort comforted, and the injurious impressions left upon her heart may be mitigated. By the righteousness of God! To gladden her heart is to lend cheer to the hearts of the Supreme Concourse; while to comfort her is to impart consolation to the company of the Celestial Host. Upon thee be the Glory of God. 'Ayn 'Ayn

In another Tablet He says.

*His most sweet utterance:*

O thou holy and luminous leaf! Truly, in the path of God thou wast at all times the dawning-place of calamities and the focus of afflictions. Thou didst drink no draught of water in tranquillity, nor live a day without uttering a heart-consuming sigh. No night didst thou rest on the bed of comfort, nor for a moment didst thou taste the honey of tranquillity of heart and peacefulness of soul. Yet be not saddened, neither be thou sick at heart: for if placidity of heart, tranquillity of spirit, and bodily repose were truly beloved, praiseworthy and desirable, His Holiness the Prince of Martyrs would assuredly have sought and yearned after them; while all the Prophets and holy ones would have chosen them for themselves. Know therefore that calamities suffered in the path of the True One are a bounty; and contentment under His decree is among the characteristics of the people of God. ... 'Ayn 'Ayn

2\) Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí, the son of the Beloved of Martyrs, was at the time of the latter's martyrdom four years of age. Later he was joined in wedlock to one of the grand-daughters of the sister of the King of Martyrs.

3\) Another son of the Beloved of Martyrs was Mírzá Ahmad, who at the time of his illustrious father's martyrdom was eleven years old. He married a woman, not wholly convinced of the truth of the Cause, named Tal'at, who bore him children. After the passing of Áqá Mírzá Ahmad, a Tablet was revealed for her from the sacred Pen of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- in which He counsels her to show forth faithfulness, and to devote herself to the education of her children so that they might be gathered under the shadow of the Cause. This lady did not, however, heed the Divine admonition, and came to an unhappy end. The text of that Blessed Tablet is as follows.

*His most sweet utterance:*

*The Land of Sád*

He is God

*The faithful and well-assured Maidservant of God, Consort of him who hath returned unto a seat of truth, Áqá Mírzá Ahmad, upon her be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious*

He is the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious

O maidservant of the Lord, thou goodly and luminous leaf! Although this calamity was so grievous that a mountain of iron would not have strength and patience to endure it, nor would the mightiest structure be able to withstand it, yet is the wisdom of the All-Glorious Lord hidden and concealed. Uncouth souls, however, are incapable of travelling and journeying in this vast immensity, nor do they advert to the truth of the mysteries of the One True God. At all events, thou must make patience and fortitude thine inner and outer raiment, and be content with the decree of God. The gaze of His loving-kindness is turned upon thee, and the glances of the Abhá Kingdom surround thy whole being. If thou conduct thyself with faithfulness, and, God willing, comport thyself in such wise as to bring consolation to the hearts, and ensure for the children a goodly upbringing and education, it will be a source of the greatest joy and happiness. In the sight of the True One, faithfulness is the greatest of all matters. 'Ayn 'Ayn

*Photograph of Hájj Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, eldest son of the Beloved of Martyrs*

4\) Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, the eldest of the children of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, was at the time of his illustrious father's martyrdom fifteen years of age. He subsequently married the daughter of his honour the King of Martyrs, whose name was Sakínih Begum, and their union resulted a year later in the birth of a daughter, whom they named Khánum Díyá'. Not long thereafter the respected wife of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, Sakínih Begum, took ill and winged her flight to the Abhá Kingdom. When news of this event reached the Most Holy Court, a Tablet was revealed for Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq to the effect that he and the bereaved relatives of the martyrs were to have the honour of visiting those blessed precincts. Accordingly, he, together with Khurshíd Begum "Shamsu'd-Duhá;" Fátimih Begum, wife of the King of Martyrs; Khánum Afandí, sister of the aforesaid late Sakínih Begum; their two brothers; the handmaid of the King of Martyrs, named Hubbíyyih; Hanná-Sáb, the steward of the King of Martyrs; and a man-servant -- all were honoured to come into the most sacred presence of Bahá'u'lláh; and, in meeting Him Who is the King, the All-Knowing, the pangs of the vexations and calamities that had afflicted them were assuaged. This sojourn in the Holy Land was the first bounty that fell to the lot of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq after the passing of his wife. In brief, they tarried a while in those sacred purlieus until, when the period of their visit came to an end, they returned to Isfahán. Here, after organizing and arranging his affairs, Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq married his second wife, named Túbá Khánum, who was the grand-daughter of his honour Mishkín-Qalam. This marriage took place ten years after the passing of his first wife, and resulted in numerous offspring.

A Blessed Tablet was revealed by the pen of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- in honour of the consort of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq and her children, which reads as follows.

*His most sweet utterance:*

*Isfahán. The respected Consort of the late Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq; the Maidservant of God Rúhá; the Maidservant of God Húríyyih; the Maidservant of God Farah-Angíz; the Maidservant of God Aqdas; the Maidservant of God 'Adhrá; Husayn Áqá; Hasan Áqá, upon them by the Glory of God, the Most Glorious*

* He is the Most Glorious *

O ye survivors of two holy and blessed souls! Your letter was received. Its contents made clear and evident that through the protection and help of the Ancient Beauty ye remain, after the passing of his honour Sádiq, the august martyr's scion, firm and steadfast in the Cause of God. Ye are related to that servant of the Perspicuous Light, his honour Mishkín. That illustrious soul spent his whole life in humble, self-effacing, loving and sincere devotion to the Cause of God. He was the incarnation of spirit and the embodiment of light; and in outward perfections was distinguished from all his contemporaries. When he perfumed his nostrils with the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful, he became completely selfless and detached from all else but the True One, sacrificing his own rest and comfort in the path of God. He migrated from Írán to the territory of the Ottomans, and, having dwelt for a while in 'Iráq, hastened to Rumelia. From thence he travelled to the Great City of Istanbul, where he occupied himself with service. He became famed throughout all parts, and was bound in fetters for his love of God. Being subsequently banished from the Great City, he attained in Gallipoli the sacred presence of Bahá'u'lláh, and, accompanying Him on His journey thence, passed his time on board ship with the utmost joy and gladness. Upon our arrival in 'Akká, he was borne off to Cyprus, and confined in the citadel of Famagusta, where, under conditions of the utmost difficulty and hardship, he remained long captive. When the island came into the possession of the just state -- that is to say, the English government -- he was set free. At once he hastened to the Most Great Prison, and joined the companions of Bahá'u'lláh. Day and night he was occupied in transcribing and arranging the Sacred Tablets, and in producing calligraphic renderings of the Greatest Name. These pieces spread throughout all parts, so that in Írán and Túrán, Europe and America, Asia and Africa -- there is no city where some example of his penmanship is not to be found. Most of these pieces are of the Greatest Name. One of the Persian ministers in Paris even related the following: "Ere proceeding to Paris I made first a quick visit to Russia. In the city of Moscow, I was in a state of the utmost sorrow, pain and despair, until, upon entering the home of one of my friends, a highly respectable personage, my eye fell upon a tableau suspended in the upper part of the room, which had been executed with the utmost skill by his honour Mishkín. It bore the words 'Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!' When my gaze fell upon the Greatest Name, occupying as it did the place of honour in the room of this great personage, I was all at once overcome by a feeling of immense joy and happiness. To this day the memory of that joy and happiness abideth with me; nor shall I ever forget it." The person who related this was the minister Mu'ayyiru'l-Mamálik, the son-in-law of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh. He attained the blessing of belief and certitude, and whilst in Paris was occupied with various services. Ye are likewise related to that brilliant candle, his honour Sádiq. That blessed soul beheld his illustrious father, his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, a sacrificial victim on the altar of love. It is evident, therefore, what injuries he sustained. Yet he remained under all circumstances patient, and in all trials constant, until he took his flight unto the Abhá Kingdom, the infinite world. Ye are the relations of these two blessed and holy souls, and very dear in the sight of 'Abdu'l-Bahá. I therefore supplicate at the Blessed Threshold that, under the shadow of God's loving providence, and in the shelter of His protection, ye may be shielded and preserved from all visitations and afflictions, and that ye may keep the shining lamp of those two illustrious souls ever luminous and refulgent; that ye may follow their example, and be worthy offspring of those illustrious forbears. Firdawsí in the Sháh-Námih saith of Kay-Khusraw:

This happy one doth of two kings signs bewray: * Of Afrásíyáb, likewise of Kávús-Kay

Upon you be the Glory of the Most Glorious

'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás

4 Sha'bán 1339, Haifa

In brief, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, the first child of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, was born in 1278 A.H., and after completing sixty years on this mortal plane, during which he distinguished himself with all manner of spiritual and moral attainments, he ascended on the first of Shavvál of the year 1338 A.H. in Isfahán to the Divine world. His illumined grave is in the Takhtih-Fúlád district of the city. Thither a company of the friends bore his corse with all due ceremony and honour. Ere his passing, Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq had willed that a structure be reared over his and the martyrs' graves. His descendants accordingly took measures to implement his wish, and raised up an imposing edifice. But the unregenerate divines, supported by base members of the populace, objected to the structure, and persuaded the governor of Isfahán, who was a military commander, to destroy it and remove the graves. The ignorant miscreants launched an assault upon the burial ground, breaking in pieces the stones and glazed tiles of the holy graves; destroying the mausoleum; and removing all the graves of the friends in its vicinity. When this incident was recounted to His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- a Blessed Tablet was revealed, which reads as follows.

*His most sweet utterance:*

* He is God *

Thy detailed letter, dated the first of Muharram 1339, was received. Its perusal gave rise to painful sensations in my heart. Assuredly the friends of God are deeply affected by this incident in Isfahán, for inevitably the hearts of God's chosen ones are grieved by the violations wrought by enemies of the Cause. Yet, when one looketh at the reality of the matter, this incident in Isfahán affordeth also the greatest proof of the exaltation of those blessed souls, and a testimony to the abiding glory of the martyrs in the path of God. Observe ye that after the Prince of Martyrs -- may my life be a sacrifice unto Him -- was martyred in the days of the Umayyads, they utterly effaced and obliterated all traces from the place where that incident had occurred. They went so far as to plough and cultivate the desert so that the site of his martyrdom might be completely lost. Thus it was that for seventy years all traces of the place where he had been martyred were erased. The Umayyads even posted watchmen round about, for fear lest anyone should come within a farsang's distance in order to pay their respects. During this entire seventy-year period it was quite impossible to approach the site of martyrdom; and if anyone were a devout believer, only from a distance of ten farsangs would he turn towards the site of martyrdom, and pay his respects -- this too with the greatest of caution. In like manner, the illumined grave of His Holiness the Commander of the Faithful -- peace be upon Him -- was effaced and obliterated. After the 'Abbásids had extirpated the Umayyad Caliphate, and themselves mounted the throne of sovereignty, they permitted visits to the scene of martyrdom; and the lovers of His Holiness reared there various structures betokening the sanctity of that spot. After a lengthy interval, a binding edict was issued in the reign of the 'Abbásid Caliph Mutavakkil that those holy edifices should be a second time destroyed. Again they were utterly effaced and obliterated; the desert was ploughed; and all around was laid waste; nor was anyone allowed to come within even ten farsangs of the spot. So matters continued until the government, premiership and ministries fell into the hands of the Buwayhids, who were lovers of the Prince of Martyrs -- may my life be a sacrifice unto Him. Such power and ascendancy did they acquire as to deprive the 'Abbásid Caliphate of any influence: all affairs were concentrated in the hands of the Buwayhids, while the Caliph was left in his palace to busy himself with his own concerns. Under the Buwayhids the site of martyrdom was once again restored; while the illumined sepulchre of His Holiness the Commander of the Faithful was likewise raised up for the third time. 'Adudu'd-Dawlih, who is the greatest of the Buwayhid line, even renewed the Iranian monarchy, assuming the title of "Pádisháh." In the Friday sermon, after the mention of the Caliph himself came that of the kingship of 'Adudu'd-Dawlih in this guise. That day the Iranians in Baghdád celebrated as a festival, exclaiming "Praise be to God that the Iranians, having been reduced to utter nothingness, have once more raised aloft their standard!" That day too in the palace of 'Adudu'd-Dawlih outside Baghdád a musical festivity was arranged, and to the accompaniment of harp and carillon, melody and song, with stamping feet, waving arms, and clapping hands, the assembled company passed the day until late afternoon. Among the guests were a number of Iranian ministers, who put to 'Adudu'd-Dawlih the following request: "This day marketh the renewal of the Iranian monarchy, and is worthy of the utmost joy. Praise be to God, all manner of musical festivities are afoot. We pray thee, therefore, graciously to grant leave and permission that, according to the former custom of the Iranians, this auspicious day be celebrated with flask and goblet." 'Adudu'd-Dawlih replied: "The drinking of wine is agreeable in rain: 'Grateful is rain's pitter patter to topers.' Today there is no rain." After a little while a cloud appeared, followed by a heavy downpour. They said: "O king! The rain hath come! Fate and destiny have fulfilled thy bidding! No further obstacle remaineth." In brief, a new festivity got underway, and the wine-cup circulated among the guests. Meanwhile 'Adudu'd-Dawlih was taken ill. A violent pain gripped his intestines, and around dawn he gave up hope of life. They asked him: "O reverend sire! What testament hast thou to make?" He replied, "What testament should I make? I have no wish save this, that ye bury me like a sentinel at the threshold of His Holiness the Commander of the Faithful, and inscribe upon my grave: 'And their dog stretched forth his forelegs at the threshold.'" Behold, then, the latter end of these vicissitudes! Know thou of a certainty therefore that those pure graves shall become so exalted as to vie with Saturn. In the Cause of God, destruction is in itself the cause of construction, while the essence of abasement is the cause of the greatest glory. Being without name or trace is a token of the sublimest majesty. "Leave them to disport themselves with their vain pursuits." Upon thee be the Glory of the Most Glorious.

24 Safar 1339, Haifa, 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás

There now follows the Blessed Tablet of the Most Holy Abhá Beauty -- exalted be His grandeur -- in honour of the august scion of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, the late Hájj Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, upon him be the Paradise of God's Good Pleasure.

*His honour Mírzá Sádiq, upon him be the Glory of God*

He is God, exalted be He; wisdom and utterance are His estate. Sád, Dál, Qáf. The memorial of the mercy of God unto the one who quaffed the choice wine of belief, and turned unto the horizon of Him Who is the Most Compassionate, holding fast unto His cord, clinging to the hem of His robe, steadfastly serving His Cause, and gazing upon the lights of His Countenance, until he arrived in His presence, and attained unto that which the Most Compassionate hath sent down in the Furqán, and in the Evangel, the Torah and the Psalms. Of Himself, and by Himself, the Tongue of Grandeur testifieth that there is no God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. He hath come down from the heaven of Proof with the standards of Perspicuous Utterance. Blessed be whoever witnesseth, and answereth His summons, and woe betide every heedless one, shut out as by a veil! O thou who hast come before this Wronged One, and dwellest now in His vicinity! He, verily, beareth witness that thou hast attained unto the promised reunion, and set thyself towards the True One at a time when all men have turned aside, except such as God, the Lord of all that was and shall be, was pleased to guide. Thou hast directed thy footsteps unto the Furthermost Goal and the Loftiest Summit, and hast soared up on the wings of detachment to the Lord of all creation, until thou didst stand before a Gate that hath been flung open before the dwellers of both the seen and the unseen realms. Render thou thanks unto God for that the Pen of the Most High so testifieth of thee on this moonlit night, when the Wronged One is seated upon His throne, and uttereth that which draweth the people nigh unto a glorious station. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast chosen thy destination, and set out upon thy journey, in such wise that neither the vagaries of the rulers nor the veils of the learned could deter thee; and hast left thy home trusting wholly in God, thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Loving. We pray God to confirm and assist thee to do that which is pleasing and acceptable unto Him; and to cause to appear from thee in the world that which shall last as long as His Most Excellent Names and His Most Exalted Attributes shall last. Powerful is He to do that which He pleaseth through His word "Be," and it is. Praise be to God that thou hast hearkened, hast attained, and hast set thyself towards Him at a time when all have risen up to oppose Him. I beseech the One True God graciously to assist thee to preserve this most exalted station. He is the Almighty, the Most Powerful. The letter his honour Amín -- upon whom be My glory and My loving-kindness -- sent to thee was perused. The love and affection he expressed for thee and the members of thy household occasioned joy and gladness. We pray God to assist and succour him. He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. In truth, his honour Amín is steadfast in faith, and constant in rendering service. Blessed are they who are adorned with the adornment of love for the Twin Martyrs, for thee, and for thy kindred. Ye, verily, have an eminent position in the sight of God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed be whoever turneth towards you; attaineth the bounty of your love; and heareth that which your tongue uttereth concerning the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Wise. The Glory of Our presence rest upon you, and upon Amín, and upon all that are staunch and steadfast, and all that are unwaveringly firm in their belief, and faithful to their trust.

Hereafter follows the prayer for forgiveness revealed by the pen of the Centre of the Covenant in honour of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq -- upon him be 9.

* He is God *

O my God, O my God! Not a day hath passed over 'Abdu'l-Bahá that hath not brought with it for him some dire calamity, nor any night hath ended wherein he hath not heard tidings of some grievous affliction such as to cause hearts to break, souls to melt, tears to flow, and sighs to ascend to heaven. O my Lord! This exalted offshoot of the tree of Supreme Sacrifice, the Beloved of Martyrs, was sore beset by tempests, and battered by gales, until at length he was uprooted by the hand of destiny, and extirpated by the assault of life's allotted term. O my Lord! This offshoot was once ripe and succulent, fresh and verdant through the outpourings of the cloud of Thy favours, and astir through the breeze blowing from the heaven of thy loving-kindness. He bore tribulations in Thy path, and was patient under adversities in Thy love. O my Lord! The wicked doers despoiled him, wrongfully, offensively, high-handedly and tyrannically, of his wealth and chattels, and ever, throughout his life, assailed him with arrows, spears and lances, and goaded him with lashing tongues, while the abject tormented him with their gloating and censure; neither did they weary of inflicting harm upon him, or cease from their enmity and oppression. Yet he remained patient under all manner of afflictions, and thankful in adversity, comporting himself with dignity amongst all people, oblivious alike of the blame of the blamer, and the dominion of the reviler. Rather, he stood as firm as the mountains before the iniquity of the people of error, and ever invoked Thee with all lowliness and fervour, saying: "Praised be Thou, O my God, for that Thou hast made me the heir of the Beloved of Martyrs, and the especial object of Thy mercy in this city that hath made such show of hatred and animosity. O my Lord! Make me patient under Thy trials; thankful under Thy decree; and steadfast in Thy Covenant and Testament, so that I may not be shaken by the onslaught of doubts, nor my feet be caused to slip by the calumnies of them that are shut out as by a veil from Thee; nay, may I rather rend asunder the veils, and behold the lights of Thy Beauty beaming from the kingdom of Thy signs. O my Lord! The veiled ones murmur privily night and day, while the breakers of Thy Covenant confer in whispers both at eventide and at dawn. Make me then a mighty barrier in the face of those ill-wishers, and an impregnable stronghold capable of resisting the dominion of those recreants. Protect me, then, from every wicked and mendacious aggressor, and from every debased and profligate assailant that feareth not the Day of Judgment. O my Lord! Make firm my steps on the Sirát; strengthen me in the pathway of deliverance; and grant that I may be numbered during the days of my life with Thy sincere servants, and after my passing with those who attain unto Thy favours. O my Lord! Rain down upon me the showers of Thy mercy; submerge me in the oceans of Thy forgiveness; illumine my countenance with the light of Thy pardon and Thy bestowal; rear for me a frequented fane within the precincts of Thy mercy; cause me to ascend unto the kingdom of Thy favours; and grant me a refuge from the torment of the ring-leaders of tyranny and oppression, that I may repose beneath the shadow of the Lote Tree of Thy mercifulness, and find shelter in the cave of Thy singleness. O my Lord! I am poor, enrich me from the treasury of Thy kingdom; captive, release me; broken, restore me, O Thou Healer of my spirit, of my heart, and of my mind; and lift me up unto the kingdom of Thy tender mercy." O my Lord! He, verily, left behind him children and grand-children: keep them safe by Thine aid and protection; guard them under the watchful glances of the eyes of Thy Lordship; and assist them to follow in the footsteps of their noble father, so that they may remain firm in their faith, and shun the people of error and rebellion. Guard them from the malice of those people who walk in the way of the Evil Whisperer, that they may be signs of guidance amidst mankind, and offshoots of the tree that was cut down in Thy path by the swords of oppression and hatred. Thus may their characters conform to their descent, and they may become the secrets of their sires and grandsires. Make theirs a true, not figurative, relation, that it be not said "O Noah! He, truly, is not of thy kindred: he, truly hath wrought unrighteously." O my Lord! Assist them; rear them up; and render them victorious over the heedless people. O my Lord! This august offshoot of that noble tree was, in truth, a faithful servant at the threshold of Thy Lordship, and turned his face wholly unto Thy noble countenance. Surround him, then, with Thine effulgent grace, so that he may attain unto a most glorious recompense; be immersed in the sea of light in the world of mysteries; become a dweller of the Most Exalted Paradise; enjoy the delights of the Garden of Refuge; and, like unto the birds upon the branches of the Lote Tree beyond which there is no passing, hymn ever anthems in celebration of Thy praise and Thy sanctity. Thou, verily, art the Ever-Forgiving; and Thou, verily, art the Benevolent, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás

*Mishkín-Qalam*

Incidentally to this relation mention was made of the late Mishkín-Qalam, whose grand-daughter, Túbá Khánum, became the consort of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, the son of His honour the Beloved of Martyrs; wherefore, to supplement the respected readers' information, a brief account will now also be provided of his auspicious life.

Mishkín-Qalam was one of the outstanding early believers, and notable members of that privileged company who dwelt in close proximity to Bahá'u'lláh, and circled about His throne. His blessed name was Mírzá Husayn, and he was a native of Isfahán. Edward Browne has mistakenly characterized him in the introduction to the book *Nuqtatu'l-Káf* as "Khurásání" -- that is, a native of Khurásán. The circumstantial account and biographical description of him bequeathed by the pen of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- in *Memorials of the Faithful* is as follows.

*His most sweet utterance:*

*Mishkín-Qalam*

*Photograph of Mishkín-Qalam*

Among the exiles, neighbours, and prisoners there was also a second Mír 'Imád, the eminent calligrapher, Mishkín-Qalam. He wielded a musk-black pen, and his brows shone with faith. He was among the most noted of mystics, and had a witty and subtle mind. The fame of this spiritual wayfarer reached out to every land. He was the leading calligrapher of Persia and well known to all the great; he enjoyed a special position among the court ministers of Tihrán, and with them he was solidly established. He was famed throughout Asia Minor; his pen was the wonder of all calligraphers, for he was adept at every calligraphic style. He was besides, for human virtues, a bright star. // This highly accomplished man first heard of the Cause of God in Isfahán, and the result was that he set out to find Bahá'u'lláh. He crossed the great distances, measured out the miles, climbing mountains, passing over deserts and over the sea, until at last he came to Adrianople. Here he reached the heights of faith and assurance; here he drank the wine of certitude. He responded to the summons of God, he attained the presence of Bahá'u'lláh, he ascended to that apogee where he was received and accepted. By now he was reeling to and fro like a drunkard in his love for God, and because of his violent desire and yearning, his mind seemed to wander. He would be raised up, and then cast down again; he was as one distracted. He spent some time under the sheltering grace of Bahá'u'lláh, and every day new blessings were showered upon him. Meanwhile he produced his splendid calligraphs; he would write out the Most Great Name, "Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!," with marvellous skill, in many different forms, and would send them everywhere. // He was then directed to go on a journey to Constantinople, and set out with his honour Sayyáh. When he reached that Great City, the leading Persians and Turks received him with every honour at first, and they were captivated by his jet black, calligraphic art. He, however, began boldly and eloquently to teach the Faith. The Persian ambassador lurked in ambush; betaking himself to the Sultán's vizirs he slandered Mishkín-Qalam. "This man is an agitator," the ambassador told them, "sent here by Bahá'u'lláh to stir up trouble and make mischief in this Great City. He has already won over a large company, and he intends to subdue still more. These Bahá'ís turned Persia upside down; now they have started in on the capital of Turkey. The Persian Government put 20,000 of them to the sword, hoping by this tactic to quench the fires of sedition. You should awaken to the danger; soon this perverse thing will blaze up here as well. It will consume the harvest of your life; it will burn up the whole world. Then you can do nothing, for it will be too late." // Actually that mild and submissive man, in that throne city of Asia Minor, was occupied solely with his calligraphy and his worship of God. He was striving to bring about not sedition but fellowship and peace. He was seeking to reconcile the followers of different faiths, not to drive them still further apart. He was of service to strangers and was helping to educate the native people. He was a refuge to the hapless and a horn of plenty to the poor. He invited all comers to the oneness of humankind; he shunned hostility and malice. // The Persian ambassador, however, wielded enormous power, and he had maintained close ties with the ministers for a very long time. He prevailed on a number of persons to insinuate themselves into various gatherings and there to make every kind of false charge against the believers. Urged on by the oppressors, spies began to surround Mishkín-Qalam. Then, as instructed by the ambassador, they carried reports to the Prime Minister, stating that the individual in question was stirring up mischief day and night, that he was a trouble maker, a rebel and a criminal. The result was, they jailed him and they sent him away to Gallipoli, where he joined our own company of victims. They despatched him to Cyprus and ourselves to the 'Akká prison. On the island of Cyprus, his honour Mishkín was held prisoner in the citadel at Famagusta, and in this city he remained, a captive, from the year 85 till 94. // When Cyprus passed out of Turkish hands, Mishkín-Qalam was freed and betook himself to his Well-Beloved in the city of 'Akká, and here he lived encompassed by the grace of Bahá'u'lláh, producing his marvellous calligraphs and sending them about. He was at all times joyous of spirit, ashine with the love of God, like a candle burning its life away, and he was a consolation to all the believers. // After the ascension of Bahá'u'lláh, Mishkín-Qalam remained loyal, solidly established in the Covenant. He stood before the violators like a brandished sword. He would never go half way with them; he feared no one but God; not for a moment did he falter, nor ever fail in service. // Following the ascension he made a journey to India, where he associated with the lovers of truth. He spent some time there, making fresh efforts every day. When I learned that he was getting helpless, I sent for him at once and he came back to this Most Great Prison, to the joy of the believers, who felt blessed to have him here again. He was at all times my close companion. He had amazing verve, intense love. He was a compendium of perfections: believing, confident, serene, detached from the world, a peerless companion, a wit -- and his character like a garden in full bloom. For the love of God, he left all good things behind; he closed his eyes to success, he wanted neither comfort nor rest, he sought no wealth, he wished only to be free from the defilement of the world. He had no ties to this life, but spent his days and nights supplicating and communing with God. He was always smiling, effervescing; he was spirit personified, love embodied. For sincerity and loyalty he had no match, nor for patience and inner calm. He was selflessness itself, living on the breaths of the spirit. // If he had not been in love with the Blessed Beauty, if he had not set his heart on the Realm of Glory, every worldly pleasure could have been his. For wherever he went, his many calligraphic styles would have been a substantial capital, and his great accomplishments would have brought him attention and respect from rich and poor alike. But he was hopelessly enamoured of man's one true Love, and thus he was free of all those other bonds, and could float and soar in the spirit's endless sky. // Finally, when I was absent, he left this darksome, narrow world and hastened away to the land of lights. There, in the haven of God's boundless mercy, he found infinite rewards. Unto him be praise and salutations, and the Supreme Companion's tender grace.

Mírzá Husayn, known as "Mishkín-Qalam," was the son of the late Hájí Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Tájir-i-Isfahání. He was born in Isfahán in 1227 A.H., and after reaching maturity set about acquiring the rudiments of education customary in that age. He possessed a quite extraordinary capacity, native wit, and intelligence. While he was still young his father resolved to choose for him his life's partner, and contracted for Mírzá Husayn a marriage with a girl named Ághá Begum. The result of this union was a daughter, Sháh Begum, who was later joined in wedlock to a merchant named Áqá Mírzá Javád, known as Ántík-Furúsh, the son of Mírzá Abu'l-Hasan-i-Tájir. From this match was born a daughter, Túbá Khánum, who became afterwards the wife of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, the son of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs. They in turn brought forth goodly offspring, whose names were listed individually above. Let us now pursue the biographical account of Mishkín-Qalam, which is the subject of these remarks. The father of Mishkín-Qalam, the late Hájí Muhammad-'Alí, was engaged in trade, and had dealings with reputed merchants both far and near. By chance, one of the merchants with whom he had dealings in Tihrán (or, by another account, in Mashhad), received from him a large quantity of merchandise, but for long remitted no payment; neither did he despatch any goods in return to the Hájí in Isfahán, nor was any word to be had of him. In order to discover how it fared with his business partner, Hájí Muhammad-'Alí decided to pay him a visit, and accordingly set off for Tihrán and Mashhad. Upon investigation, it emerged that his partner had become bankrupt and gone out of business. This intelligence discomfited the Hájí beyond measure -- to the degree indeed that he did not return to Isfahán, but bade farewell to life. His son, after receiving news of the passing of his father, himself set out for Tihrán in order to settle the accounts, and determine with the bankrupt party what course to take. At this period Mírzá Husayn was proficient in the various styles of penmanship; and was unrivalled throughout Írán for the exquisite beauty of his compositions and designs. Among his skills was the ability to produce on paper with his own fingernail the finest calligraphic designs, which he executed in an elegant white script. This writer has seen examples of his fingernail scripts. He was also, much to the amazement and bewilderment of the beholder, able to make sketches of people on paper by this same method. Whilst in Tihrán, he happened one day to be seated in the shop of an acquaintance when, with great pomp and circumstance, the procession of the Grand Vizir passed by. In the short space of time ere he disappeared from view, Mishkín-Qalam drew his likeness on a piece of paper with his fingernail, and handed it to his companion. The latter showed it to the Grand Vizir as he returned by the same route, and presented to him Mírzá Husayn. The Grand Vizir took him to the court, and, having again tested his abilities, introduced him to the Sháh. The Sháh extolled his skill, and established him in the position of tutor to the Valí-'Ahd, who was resident in Tabríz. He also bestowed upon Mírzá Husayn the title "Mishkín-Qalam," and lavished upon him numerous favours. Mishkín-Qalam sent his income to his family in Isfahán; but after a while his wife Ághá Begum travelled to Tihrán, and besought the Sháh to release her husband. After much coming and going, the Sháh granted Mishkín-Qalam leave to proceed to Isfahán, albeit only for a temporary and limited sojourn, that he might attend to the needs of his family. Mishkín-Qalam therefore returned to Isfahán; and it is to this visit that is owed the birth of another child, Mírzá 'Alí-Akbar. The latter subsequently married in the Holy Land, and produced a number of offspring, who, according to reports, are now resident in Baghdád, Damascus and Syria. In brief, Mishkín-Qalam's leave of absence came to an end, and, as bidden, he set out for Tihrán; but, receiving on the way the Divine Summons from Siyyid Mihdí, he became a believer in the Cause. So ardently indeed did he embrace it that, detached from all else but God, and forsaking all worldly attachments such as rank and wealth, he proceeded instead to Baghdád, and thence to Adrianople, where he was honoured to enter the Court of the presence of His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh -- exalted be His glory. The Sháh, becoming aware of his protracted absence, appointed persons to seek after him; but they could find no trace of him. As all this was in train, Mishkín-Qalam's wife, as previously mentioned, bestowed her daughter Sháh Begum in marriage upon Áqá Mírzá Javád. This latter, who was engaged in trade, had dealings and connections with the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, while at the same time his father was connected with the circle of the Imám-Jum'ih, for whom he worked as overseer. Áqá Mírzá Javád was sorrowed and troubled by the absence of Mishkín-Qalam. One day, the King of Martyrs and his brother, learning of the state of his heart, and of the fretful turmoil occasioned him by the disappearance of his father-in-law, whom he believed to be lost without trace, sought to assuage his anguish. "It being now more than twenty years since Mishkín-Qalam disappeared without trace," Áqá Mírzá Javád courteously informed them, "His wife is much afflicted by his absence; and my wife too grieveth her father's absence. The more diligently we search for him, the more hopeless seemeth our quest." The brothers now asked him whether, if he saw a picture of Mishkín-Qalam, he would recognize him. "Yes indeed," he replied. They then showed him a picture of Mishkín-Qalam, and put his mind at rest that Mishkín-Qalam was alive, unharmed, and in good health. Mírzá Javád took back the picture to his grieving womenfolk, and cheered and comforted them with the tidings that Mishkín-Qalam was well. He took them to the home of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, where arrangements were in due course made for the removal of the wife and son of Mishkín-Qalam to the Holy Land, and for their journey thither. Meanwhile Mishkín-Qalam's daughter and her husband moved in with the family of the two respected brothers; and these arrangements proved so congenial that in the end, as we have previously related, Áqá Mírzá Javád's daughter Túbá Khánum became united in wedlock with Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, the eldest son of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs. In fine, Mishkín-Qalam was the object of surpassing favour; and after the ascension of the Ancient Beauty remained firm in the Covenant and Testament of God. Up to the ascension of the Blessed Beauty he signed his finished calligraphic works "Thrall of the Gate of Bahá', Mishkín-Qalam;" while thereafter, during the period of the Covenant and Testament, he signed them "Thrall of the Thrall of Bahá, Mishkín-Qalam." In the porch of one of the major cemeteries of Tabríz, which is situated near a famous Imám-Zádih, is an inscription, consisting of a very extensive ode, in the hand of Mishkín-Qalam, and signed also in his name. Mírzá Husayn "Mishkín-Qalam" was, as mentioned, born in 1227 A.H. After joining him in the Holy Land, his wife Ághá Begum sewed some of the sacred garments worn by the Blessed Beauty and the dwellers of the Tabernacle of Grandeur, and there at length passed away. Mishkín-Qalam ascended to the Abhá Kingdom in 1327 A.H. The person who had taught him the Faith was Áqá Siyyid Mihdí, while in the case of his daughter, Sháh Begum, and his son-in-law, the late Áqá Mírzá Javád, this office was performed by Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alíy-i-Isfahání, author of the works *Bihjatu's-Sudúr* and *Dalá'ilu'l-'Irfán*. Sháh Begum was born in 1252 A.H., and, full a hundred and nine years old, passed away in Muharram of the year 1361 A.H. in Tihrán, where she was laid to rest in the Eternal Rose Garden of the Land of Tá'. Many delightful tales and anecdotes are preserved of Mishkín-Qalam, which there is not here space to record. Most of these are, however, current upon the tongues, and familiar from the discourse, of the friends of God. A number of Tablets were revealed for Mishkín-Qalam by the sacred pens of Their Holinesses Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá, which are available to the body of the friends.

*Áqá Mírzá Hasan, The King of Martyrs*

Another son of Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, the son of Hájí Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Nahrí, was Áqá Mírzá Hasan, who was born in 1252 A.H., and subsequently styled by the pen of the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- the King of Martyrs, the title by which he became known. As previously recorded, after the passing of Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím wed Shamsu'd-Duhá, the wife of his deceased brother; and bestowed also her daughter, Fátimih Begum, on his middle son, Áqá Mírzá Hasan, the King of Martyrs.

The King of Martyrs was born in the year 1252 A.H. An account of Fátimih Begum has already been provided. At all events, the line of Áqá Mírzá Hasan, the King of Martyrs, was continued by a number of offspring.

The eldest of these was a boy named Jalál, who at the time of his father's martyrdom was in his twelfth year. Subsequent to that event, he travelled to the Holy Land; became the object of Divine bounty; and was honoured to become the son-in-law of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, begetting offspring of his own, as was touched upon in the account provided of the respected Consort of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá.

Another child of the King of Martyrs was a girl by the name of Sakínih Begum, who, as previously recorded, was joined in wedlock to Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, the son of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs. Khánum Díyá', subsequently the wife of Mírzá 'Ináyatu'lláh-i-Isfahání, was the fruit of this union, as was also previously mentioned.

*Photograph of his honour the King of Martyrs, Áqá Mírzá Hasan*

Another child of the King of Martyrs was a daughter by the name of Khánum Afandí, who in the Holy Land wedded Siyyid Yahyá, the brother of the respected Consort of the Centre of the Covenant and Testament, and the son of Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí. The result of this union was a daughter named Khurshíd Khánum. At the time of her father's martyrdom in Isfahán Khánum Afandí was seven years old.

Another child of the King of Martyrs was 'Abdu'l-Husayn, who after his father's martyrdom proceeded to the Holy Land, where, at the age of eighteen, he passed away.

*Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl*

Another of Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím's sons was Mírzá Ismá'íl, who was somewhat younger than the Twin Shining Lights. At the time when these latter were seized upon, he too was apprehended and made a prisoner; but on the fifth day he was released from confinement, and so spared death and martyrdom. This fact has been expressly mentioned in the Mathnaví of the late 'Andalíb, an article by Abu'l-Fadá'il, and other sources. Some of the relatives of the Twin Shining Lights have mentioned that the Imám-Jum'ih, wishing to extinguish a debt of eighteen thousand túmáns he owed them, and fearing lest the younger brother, who had emerged from prison, should set about recovering this sum, in order to appease and silence him cast a shawl about his shoulders, and announced that Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl had become a Muslim. Never, however, did the latter utter a word that could by any means be construed as signifying that he had recanted, or lost his belief in the wondrous Divine Cause. In evidence of this is a Blessed Tablet and supplication for forgiveness revealed in his honour by the sacred pen of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, in which, after rendering thanks and praise to God, He intercedes for him as follows.

*His most sweet utterance:*

... and now, O my God, I turn from praising Thee to asking Thy forgiveness, Thy pardon and Thy favour for the one who was related to Thee, who put his reliance in Thee, and who hastened unto Thee that haply he might attain Thy presence; the namesake of him that was chosen to be slain, Thy servant Ismá'íl. O my Lord! O my Lord! He was a believer in Thee and in Thy signs; was tormented at the hands of Thine enemies, and afflicted during Thy days by reason of his relation to Thee, until at length death fastened upon him its claws; the Hour set down its burdens; and he returned unto Thee, lowly, humble, and submissive, hoping for Thy pardon and for reunion with Thee. O my Lord! O my Lord! Give him to drink from the cup of forgiveness; bestow upon him Thy kindness and favour; cause him to enter the Kingdom of Mercy, O Thou Lord of Grace and Bounty! Thou, verily, art the Mighty, the Loving. Thereafter I beseech Thee, falling on my face to the dust, bowing down and prostrating myself before Thee, O my Gracious and All-Bountiful Lord, to forgive him who was related to the Door of Thy Oneness, who supplicated the Court of Thy Mercifulness, and who was wont to guard against, and hide from, the assault of the enemies, until the end drew nigh; the time to bid farewell approached; and, forsaking all save Thee, he responded unto Thy call. His heart grew lowly; his love surged; his eyes ran down with tears in this extremity; and he sighed as one distraught with love during those days, such was his yearning towards Thee. He begged forgiveness for his transgression, trusting in Thee; and pronounced his confession before the remnant of God's mercy, declaring: "I, verily, am returning unto my Lord, the All-Bountiful, who beholdeth me in this perplexity. Thou, verily art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Glorious, the Most Generous, the Loving." 'Ayn 'Ayn

The truth of his condition is in reality and actual fact made completely clear and evident by the tenor and expressions of the above Blessed Tablet. Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl married the daughter of Mírzá Taqí, son of Mírzá Muhammad-Shafí'-i-Khú'í, who was among the circle of those close to the Imám-Jum'ih, Mír Siyyid Muhammad. Mírzá Taqí, his daughter Rabábih Sultán, and the rest of his relations were all Muslims and inimical to the Cause. According to the received account, this Mírzá Taqí, the father-in-law of Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl, wrote on his son-in-law's behalf a letter to the Imám-Jum'ih, explicitly denying that he was affiliated with the Cause of God, or a believer in the Divine Law. Confirming its tenor, the Imám and the Shaykh wrote in the margin of the letter that Mírzá Ismá'íl was a Muslim, and sent him a ceremonial robe. By this means Rabábih Sultán and her father saved their relation by marriage from imprisonment and other trials. But in any case, this measure was to no avail, for only about a year after the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl passed away. His wife and family were outside the Cause, nor has any mention survived of them. In the supplication for forgiveness revealed for Mírzá Ismá'íl by the sacred pen of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the two expressions that he was "wont to *guard against*, and *hide from*, the assault of the enemies" indicate that during that period of testing he was attempting to dissimulate and conceal his belief. Assuredly, however, God's merciful favours after his passing will ensure the forgiveness of his sins, and the pardon of his transgressions. In a Blessed Tablet revealed from the pen of the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- in honour of Áqá Mírzá Áqáy-i-Afnán, known as Núri'd-Dín, the following has been revealed in respect of Mírzá Ismá'íl.

*His exalted Utterance:*

As for what thou didst write concerning his honour Mírzá Ismá'íl, his letter was presented in its entirety. He said: "In some of what he hath mentioned he is right. He should be treated with kindliness and forbearance." A most sublime and holy Tablet was also revealed especially for him from the firmament of Grace, and despatched hence. Do thou o'erlook it, and send it on. Our Lord, truly, is the Ordainer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The aforenamed Mírzá hath however fallen into great perplexity. Although he is right in asserting that the Cause is great, inasmuch as it is related unto God, yet were he to immerse himself a while in the ocean of awareness he would perceive that it is, and ever shall be, the finest, the greatest, the truest, the most perfect, and the most exalted of all matters in the world. *Finis*.

*Áqá Mírzá Kázim*

Another of Mírzá Ibráhím's children was a boy named Mírzá Kázim. Having attained the blessing of faith and certitude, he ascended to the eternal world in his twenty-fifth year. As was recorded in the account of her Holiness the respected Consort of the Centre of the Divine Covenant and Testament, when deprived of the companionship of his cousin Fátimih Khánum, the daughter of his paternal uncle Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, he succumbed to a malady, closed his eyes to this world, and removed to the everlasting realm. Áqá Mírzá Kázim was buried in Sar-Qabr Áqá, where his resting-place is known.

*Khadíjih Sultán Begum*

Another child of Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím was a girl named Khadíjih Sultán Begum, who, after attaining the years of maturity and discretion, was joined in wedlock to a wealthy Muslim by the name of Hájí 'Abdu'l-Ghaffár, thereafter enjoying, as was the custom in that period, the attendance of numerous men and women servants. A number of sons and daughters resulted from this union, as for example Zahrá Begum, who married a Muslim merchant, from whom she had numerous offspring: among them Liqá'íyyih Khánum, who became the wife of Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí, son of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, and who, as previously mentioned, produced five children of her own, namely, Mírzá Ibráhím, Mírzá Ismá'íl, Mírzá Hasan, Ridváníyyih and Munavvar Khánum, all of them lovers of the Cause; and another named Munavvar Khánum. Another of Khadíjih Sultán's daughters, Fátimih Begum, wed after her mother's passing one Mírzá Áqá, brother of Mírzá Fadlu'lláh Malik, and had two daughters, Munírih and Tal'at by name, who do not associate with the friends. A third daughter of Khadíjih Sultán Begum, whose name was Gawhar Begum, passed away at the age of fifteen as the result of an apoplectic fit. Khadíjih Begum bore also two sons, namely Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí and Mírzá 'Abdu'l-Husayn, both of whom passed away in their infancy. Her husband too passed on after suffering the collapse of his business in Tihrán. Of necessity Khadíjih Sultán then travelled from Tihrán to Isfahán, where finally, still only in her thirty-fifth year, she ascended to the Abhá Kingdom. After the martyrdom of her beloved brothers she was immensely downcast and disconsolate. Ruffians dragged her from the home of her Muslim husband, and carried her before Zillu's-Sultán; but when the governor tried to persuade her to recant, Khadíjih Sultán stood firm. He then returned her to the home of her husband, who bore her off with him from Isfahán to Tihrán, where he fixed his abode. She subsequently rendered services in the field of protecting the property of the martyrs and caring for their survivors, before passing away in Isfahán, where she was buried in Takhtih-Fúlád. After her death, a Visitation Tablet was revealed for her by the pen of the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- which reads as follows.

*His exalted Utterance:*

*The sister of the King of Martyrs, upon her be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious*

The first praise that emanated from the Tongue of Majesty and Grandeur rest upon thee, O most exalted leaf, thou who didst shine forth above the horizon of the Cause in the days of God, the Lord of all names! I testify that thou didst turn towards the Supreme Horizon, and didst attain unto that which most of the people have not attained. Thou, verily, didst bear grievous hardships and trials in the path of God; yet wast thou so steadfast in the Cause that neither the blame of the blamers nor the denial of the disbelievers could deflect thee from His way. Blessed art thou, and whosoever visiteth thy grave, and reciteth over thee that which hath been revealed by the Pen of God, the Exalted, the Most Glorious, He Whom the wrong-doers have imprisoned in the fortress-town of 'Akká. I testify moreover that thou didst yield up thy spirit by reason of thy separation, after thou hadst been ablaze with the fire of yearning in the days of God, the Lord of the Judgment Day. Woe betide a people who have not recognized thy worth, nor quaffed the cup of thy remembrance; and happy whosoever commemorateth thee in the words wherewith God Himself hath spoken in the Books and Tablets! *Finis*.

A Brief Account of the Martyrdom

Of the Twin Shining Lights

*Photographic views of the interior of the house of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs*

*Description of the Martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights*

The manner of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights, and the reason for the occurrence of this fearful event, are said to be as follows. Mír Muhammad-Husayn, who had become after his brother the Sultánu'l-'Ulamá, the Imám-Jum'ih of Isfahán, appointed Áqá Mírzá Hasan and Áqá Mírzá Husayn to act as overseers and agents of his affairs and transactions, exactly as their own father, Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, had, as previously mentioned, acted as overseer and personal agent of the previous Sultánu'l-'Ulamá and Imám-Jum'ih. For a while these two brothers financed all remittances made by the Imám, and in addition expended a huge sum in acquiring for him properties, estates and lands, setting these payments against his name in their accounts. At length they bethought them to reckon up the figures, and, after careful investigation, discovered that they had disbursed the sum of eighteen thousand túmáns in remittances on his behalf. They accordingly reported their findings to the Imám, and requested payment of the debt he owed them. The Imám, who worshipped no other god but Mammon, voiced outwardly no objection, and made arrangements for the auditing of the accounts. The process of auditing extended over forty days, during which period, night and day, the Imám, his dependents, scribe, secretary, servants and relations, under the pretext of seeing to the accounts, were for the most part accommodated in the home of the two brothers, and regaled at their table of bounty. At the end of these forty days, the Imám, finding the accounts to be accurate, promised to settle the debt he owed them. All these proceedings, however, were merely for the sake of appearance, for inwardly he was scheming to deter the two brothers by any means from pursuing their claim, or else to light upon some means of compassing their downfall, or even death. As it happened, a festivity that had been arranged to mark the betrothal of Fátimih Begum, the daughter of the Beloved of Martyrs, to Áqá Mihdí Hájí Rasúl took place at this very time, extending over an entire week. The staging of this festivity served only to inflame the envy and hatred of the Imám, and he resolved to find an accomplice in his scheme of disposing of his faithful creditor. By chance, he met one day in the public bath the well-known mujtahid Shaykh Báqir, who would afterwards be styled by the pen of the Most Sacred Abhá Beauty the "Wolf;" bared to him the secret design of his heart; and, agreeably with the principle that "The devils, verily, inspire unto their followers specious words beguilingly," induced the Shaykh, through the tempting prospect of laying hands upon the wealth and property of those two brothers, to become a partner in his scheme. Then and there in the public bath they decided by what dastardly means they would accomplish their plan of doing away with those intimates of the Divine Threshold; and resolved to make the Zillu's-Sultán, Mas'úd Mírzá, the governor-general of Isfahán and of other extensive areas of Írán, their confidential associate in this weighty undertaking. Having left the public bath, each one busied himself with his own part in the heinous plan, looking the while for a suitable opportunity to put it into effect. Among other measures, they succeeded, after meeting with Zillu's-Sultán, in enlisting him too as their accomplice. They fixed the seventeenth day of Rabí'u'l-Avval, which is by one account the Birthday of His Holiness the Apostle of God, as that on which they would lay hold upon those twin apples of the Chaste One's eye, and intimates of the Threshold of God and His Apostle. When the appointed day arrived, the three brothers went to see the Imám-Jum'ih in order to offer him their congratulations on the occasion of the Birthday of the Apostle of God -- may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him. The three in question were Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl, Áqá Mírzá Hasan and Áqá Mírzá Husayn, brief accounts of each of whom have been provided in the foregoing. At this reception, which was thronged by high and low alike, Áqá Muhammad-Báqir-i-Mudarris, who was a respected, grave and eminent figure, the father-in-law of Zillu's-Sultán, and an acquaintance and friend of the illumined brothers, warned Áqá Mírzá Hasan, "Get thee out of this inauspicious gathering with all possible haste, and hide thee in some safe place, for the Imám is resolved that thou shouldst die." Another of his acquaintances who was also present in the gathering confirmed these words. At once, and without informing anyone, Áqá Mírzá Hasan left for the home of Áqá Muhammad-Báqir-i-Mudarris. The two other brothers remained in the gathering; but after a while arose, and sought the Imám's permission to depart. This the Imám refused to grant, saying, "I have business with you." "Where is Áqá Mírzá Hasan?" he asked. They replied, "He hath already left." The Imám was displeased, and sent off several officials with instructions to lay hold upon him wherever they should find him, and bring him before him. The officials, accompanied by a crowd of miscreants and ruffians, went first to the home of Áqá Mírzá Hasan, beat upon the door, and demanded to be informed of his whereabouts. The members of his household replied that he had gone to the home of the Imám and not yet returned. The pitiless band entered the house to search it, not sparing to commit certain indignities; but finding there no trace of Áqá Mírzá Hasan, proceeded to other homes and locations. Finally, at the direction of certain trouble-makers, they turned their steps towards the home of Áqá Muhammad-Báqir-i-Mudarris. The Shaykh and the Imám sent a message to the governor in the following terms: "Áqá Mírzá Hasan is hidden in the home of Áqá Báqir: do thou command him to deliver him into our hands." Dismayed by this communication, the governor sent word to Áqá Báqir. Upon hearing what had happened, Áqá Báqir was sorely troubled, and at once departed for his home. Having there related the story to Áqá Mírzá Hasan, he proceeded with the latter on horseback to the government house. The moment Zillu's-Sultán saw Áqá Mírzá Hasan, he assailed him with recriminations and reproaches, and bade him curse and execrate his faith. Áqá Mírzá Hasan however remained silent. Zillu's-Sultán again repeated his demand, this time more vehemently than before. Still Áqá Mírzá Hasan preserved his silence. The governor grew angry, and once more charged him to execrate his faith. When this behest met again only with silence, he became irate, and exclaimed, "Methinks the accusation that thou art a Bahá'í is true!" Áqá Báqir, wishing to allay the governor's wrath, said, "Áqá Mírzá Hasan is for the moment unsettled by this incident: it would be better for thee to shew him forbearance, and to defer this matter to another time." Zillu's-Sultán retorted, "It is not so. He meaneth rather to shew me disrespect: for this reason he deigneth not to reply." This said, with a switch he had in his hand he dealt many violent blows upon the head and face of that quintessence of piety, thereafter ordering his bloodthirsty myrmidons completely to strip that oppressed one of his raiment, and to cast him headlong into prison. Hearing of this, his family immediately sent him fresh raiment. When news of the apprehension of Áqá Mírzá Hasan reached the Imám, he sent the two other brothers to prison also. The Twin Shining Lights conveyed to their spouses a message to this effect: "Be ye patient and thankful in adversity, and under no circumstances have recourse to, or seek redress from, the Shaykh and the Imám." Their families and relatives accordingly refrained from any action of this sort. The merchants of Isfahán, however, who had transactions and dealings with those two wronged ones, and were anxious to preserve their investments, sent numerous telegrams to the Sháh of Írán, Násiri'd-Dín Sháh. A telegram came from the Sháh to Zillu's-Sultán instructing him to send the prisoners to Tihrán. In the meantime, the Shaykh and the Imám prosecuted their seditious plan, seeking to inflame the passions of the people. Zillu's-Sultán chose a group of merchants, and sent them to the prison in order to admonish the captives. Following his directions, the merchants bespake them, "Write down the names of all those with whom ye have an account." Those prisoners and angelic harbingers of the Kingdom made answer, "The people with whom we have dealings are extremely numerous, and the accounts are all set down in the trading house ledger." Returning to the governor, the merchants reported to him what had passed. Zillu's-Sultán ordered the trading ledger to be brought before him; and when this was produced, kept it with him and examined it, exclaiming in admiration at the order and method of their work. In the course of his examination he became aware that the Imám-Jum'ih owed them the sum of 18,000 túmáns, and understood why the Imám was so insistent upon their death. Successive telegrams arrived for the governor from the Sháh, conveying in respect of the prisoners an emphatic recommendation that under no circumstances should they be harmed. At all events, five days passed from the time of their apprehension without further incident; then, on the sixth day, their younger brother, Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl -- in order, so it is said, to arrange for the payment of a sum of money to Zillu's-Sultán -- was released from confinement and set free; while the two brothers whose destiny the pen of fate had decreed as martyrdom remained in prison. Since the Imám knew that the Sháh was opposed to the death of the two brothers, and had ordered their transference to Tihrán, he sought to incite the populace, and along with Shaykh Báqir and other accomplices raised the cry of "*Wá Sharí'atá!*" -- "Woe to the Sharí'ah!" The people of Isfahán shut up their shops; and finally, on 23 Rabí'u'l-Avval 1296 A.H., in the manner circumstantially set forth in the Mathnaví of 'Andalíb and the works of Abu'l-Fadá'il-i-Gulpáygání, those two heroic souls met each a martyr's death. In the arena of martyrdom, the two brothers vied with each other who should be the first to lay down his life. In the end, Áqá Mírzá Hasan drained the cup of martyrdom before his elder brother; nor did his elder brother delay long in joining him. One of the poems of Na'ím contains the following line:

Did any wronged one, save in Isfahán, * Reward the instrument of his own death?

The allusion in this verse is to his honour the King of Martyrs, Áqá Mírzá Hasan, who at the hour of his martyrdom bestowed upon his executioner a ring he had in his hand, saying: "His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh instructeth us to kiss the hand of the murderer. Here, take thou this ring as a remembrance of me." After execution had been made upon them, a cord was tied to the feet of those two enraptured worshippers in the precincts of the Best-Beloved, and they were dragged hither and thither about the city. Finally, the two bodies were cast beneath the gallows in the central square. A crowd of malefactors and miscreants rushed upon the home of those two ardent candles in the assembly of blissful reunion with the Beloved; carried off all they could find, sacking also their business chamber; and handed over the greater part of the plunder to the Imám-Jum'ih. The lamentation of the bereaved members of the two households was such as none could bear to hear. The Shaykh and the Imám sent to them this message: "If the voice of your lamentation be raised, every form of tribulation shall fall upon your heads." Thus precluded from weeping openly, those wronged ones gathered in cellars where, softly and silently, they allowed their tears to flow. The bodies of the two martyrs remaining the while where they had been cast at the foot of the gallows, ill-wishers would fain have suspended them from the gallows; but Áqá Báqir-i-Mudarris prevented this design, and, going to Zillu's-Sultán, obtained permission to bury them. The Shaykh and the Imám decreed that those luminous corses should not be buried ere three days had passed. Áqá Báqir then paid another visit to Zillu's-Sultán, as a result of which the governor issued a strongly worded farmán ordering the burial to proceed. Ere this could be carried out, however, a group of seminary students, acting under orders from the Shaykh and the Imám, tied a cord to the feet of the two martyrs, took them away, and cast them into a ruined place, where they knocked down a wall over their bodies. After exerting further efforts, Áqá Báqir finally succeeded in having those hallowed bodies laid to rest. What the members of their households suffered in the meantime He Who is the Inaccessible Truth is alone aware. A hint of their woes has nevertheless been conveyed in poetic form in the Mathnaví of 'Andalíb-i-Láhíjání -- may the mercy of God rest upon him.

It is related that on the fifth day of the wronged brothers' confinement Zillu's-Sultán received from them the sum of nine thousand túmáns, and released from prison their younger brother Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl so that he might obtain, and make payment of, a further three thousand túmáns, and also bring raiment to the prisoners. Having attended to these matters, Mírzá Ismá'íl would have returned to the prison, but his wife opposed his wish, and sent the money and raiment by another means. It is also well known that Zillu's-Sultán did not presume himself to give the order for their death, and that the Imám, the Shaykh and a number of others inscribed and sealed the fatvá decreeing their execution, and passed it on to him. The governor even tried moreover to hide his executioner, hoping by this means to forestall the event, for he was fearful of the Sháh's wrath. But Shaykh Muhammad-Taqíy-i-Najafí, the son of Shaykh Báqir, rolling up his sleeve amidst an assemblage of people, cried out: "I myself am prepared to shed their blood!" However this may be, it is related that Zillu's-Sultán too received from the Imám and the Shaykh a considerable share of the looted and pillaged property of the wronged martyrs. Leading those who ransacked the home and commercial chamber of the martyrs was the secretary and scribe of the Imám-Jum'ih, Hájí Shaykh Ahmad. The value of their property, jewels and possessions borne off as plunder was quite prodigious, and beyond reckoning. There remained in the house no vessel wherewith to give the children a drink of water, nor any scrap of food wherewith to appease the pangs of hunger. The tradespeople refused even to sell them any comestibles. At the time of their martyrdom Áqá Mírzá Husayn, the Beloved of Martyrs, was forty-five years of age, while the King of Martyrs, Áqá Mírzá Hasan, was a little over forty-three. The writer has heard the late Ghulám-Ridá Khán-i-Tawfíq, who was one of the early believers of Isfahán, relate the following: "On the day of the martyrdom of those twin luminaries I was a witness of the fearful business, and saw with my own eyes the bodies of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs fallen, stripped and naked, upon the ground. They had upon them only the scantiest covering. The sides of the twin beatific martyrs had turned black and blue from the blows which, with the soles of heavy boots, those bent on vengeance were inflicting upon the God-intoxicated pair." The Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- has stigmatised the slayer of the twin martyrs -- that is, the Imám-Jum'ih -- as the "second 'Ubaydu'lláh;" and, in a Tablet to Zaynu'l-Muqarrabín, affirms:

Through the appearance of but one of the deeds of the She-Serpent, the second 'Ubaydu'lláh hath been made manifest; and he hath committed that wherefrom the first 'Ubaydu'lláh shrank. *Finis*.

The 'Ubaydu'lláh here alluded to is the son of Zíyád Ibn-i-Abí-Hi, at whose command His Holiness the Prince of Martyrs, Husayn Ibn-i-'Alí -- peace be upon Him -- was martyred in Karbilá. The story of that event is sufficiently well known. In the course of this same Tablet Bahá'u'lláh avers:

... For whatever property hath been plundered in the Land of Sád, and for each drop of blood that hath been unjustly shed therein, innumerable souls have departed from this world, and shall depart hereafter, ... Sleep hath not overtaken the One True God, nor ever shall it. He is awake and aware, and the wrongdoers shall assuredly taste the bitter fruits of their actions. *Finis*.

Remarkably, in the famine of 1288, which afflicted the people of Írán after the martyrdom of Badí', these two brothers had shown the utmost kindness towards the people of Isfahán in general, saving a great multitude from starvation and hunger. In particular, they had lavished much kindness and assistance on a person by the name of Ramadán, who was the executioner. Yet still the people were prepared to countenance so grievous a wrong against their twin benefactors. Abu'l-Fadá'il says in the book *Fará'id*:

*The author's words (page 726):*

One of the merchants of Isfahán by the name of Muhammad-Taqí related the following: "When in 1296 A.H. there occurred the event of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights, Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn -- may God sanctify their resting-place -- I happened to go on the afternoon of 23 Rabí'u'l-Avval, which was the actual day of their martyrdom, on a business errand to Julfá, the Christian quarter, where I found all the inhabitants downcast and sorrowful at this momentous event. During my visit a foreign maid asked me why these two honourable Siyyids had been put to death. I replied, 'Because they were of the Bábí sect.' 'I know they were Bábís,' she persisted, 'But what good came of putting them to death? Were they not descendants of your Prophet, and famed for the excellence of their character and the righteousness of their conduct?' I replied, 'Our 'ulamá regard their death as a deed meriting a Divine recompense, and account it as a means of drawing nigh unto His Holiness the Lord of Lords.' Upon hearing these words, she looked at me in astonishment, and exclaimed, 'Woe to you, O unaccountable people! If slaying the lineage of the Prophet be among your good deeds, how then must be your bad deeds?' With this, she quickly averted her countenance, and with the utmost speed hastened in the direction of her home ..." *Finis*.

*Facsimile of a letter written on the Guardian's behalf to the Spiritual Assembly of Isfahán. The text of the letter is as follows: "Isfahán. The holy Spiritual Assembly, may God strengthen its pillars. // The petition presented by those Trustees of the Merciful dated (4 / 6 / 1317) arrived at the sacred court of his Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God -- may our souls be a sacrifice unto him -- and the matters detailed therein concerning the house of his honour the King of Martyrs and of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, which is accounted among the historic Holy Sites, and which, after the ascension of his honour Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, the scion of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, was divided amongst the heirs; whereas now a part of the heirs, such as Áqá Husayn-i-Mahbúbí, and Áqá Hasan-i-Mahbúbí; the Maidservant of God Qamar Khánum, the spouse of Áqá Husayn-i-Mahbúbí; the Maidservant of God Aqdas Khánum-i-Páyandih; and the Maidservant of God 'Adhrá' Khánum, have each contributed their own share to the Cause; while the Spiritual Assembly has purchased another portion of the share of the heirs -- all these matters were explained and made clear in the refulgent presence of the Guardian. // These great services and illustrious undertakings were highly extolled in the luminous court, while each one of the contributors was privileged and honoured to receive the wondrous expressions of his mercy and love. This present was written at his blessed command. // 19 Shahru'l-Qawl 95, 11 December 1938, Núri'd-Dín Zayn. // Perused, the servant of His Threshold, Shoghi"*

According to one account, the younger brother Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl, having with the help of Mudarris succeeded in retrieving the pure bodies from under the rubble of the collapsed wall, washed them in the waters of the River Níyásarm, which is among the branches of the Záyandih Rúd, and buried them in Takhtih-Fúlád. There is today in the Hazíratu'l-Quds of Isfahán a stone slab upon which, it is said, the bodies of the twin martyrs were placed for the purpose of this final ablution. The private dwelling of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs is today in the possession of the Cause.

*Reminiscences of their Honours the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs*

*Transcribed from Colonel 'Ináyatu'lláh-i-Suhráb's notebook of reminiscences*

***Standing: \--*** These two illustrious souls, setting aside their high moral and spiritual station, which manifested itself in kindness and compassion towards all people, evinced the utmost liberality in assisting the weak and the destitute, and were moreover extolled and celebrated for these exalted attributes. In respect of their commercial standing too, they enjoyed no inconsiderable reputation. It was customary during that period, when the postal service had been but newly founded, for those making postal deliveries to take the commercial letters and communications to the caravanserais and commercial houses, and, calling out the names of their recipients, invite them to receive their missives. According to the accounts of eye-witnesses, when the postal functionary arrived at the Gulshan caravanserai, and called out the names of the recipients of the letters, more than eighty percent of the incoming items were announced to be for Áqá Mírzá Hasan and Áqá Mírzá Husayn. This circumstance, it may fairly be stated, was a matter of great astonishment, as well as of envy, to the other tradespeople.

***Wealth: \--*** The wealth of the aforesaid honoured brothers was the talk of both high and low. It is known for example that no sooner had they been arrested and confined in the residence of the Imám-Jum'ih, and afterwards in that of Zillu's-Sultán, than their distant and near relatives transported from their homes to other places huge quantities and stores of coin, gold and jewels, which remained to the last days in the families of the heirs. Even so, after the martyrdom a considerable quantity of gold was carried off as spoil and plunder by the government officials of the time. The large sum they sought of the She-Serpent, so engendering the enmity that resulted in their martyrdom, constitutes moreover a clear proof of the superabundance of their wealth. It is known that on the very day of their martyrdom there arrived in Isfahán a caravan laden with their wares, which, after it had proceeded to the Maydán-i-Naqsh-i-Jihán, known as the Maydán-i-Sháh, and its ownership been ascertained, was confiscated in its entirety by the government.

***Generosity: \--*** It is known that the assistance of the two brothers was extended without distinction to all people, including even Ramadán the executioner, who was afterwards compelled to put them to death. For a while Ramadán sought by various pretexts to put off the deed, considering himself to be indebted to the two brothers for various favours they had rendered him.

*One or two instances of the results of the martyrdom: \--*

***1 --*** Banánu'l-Mulk, the father of Fadlu'lláh-i-Banán-i-Shírází, who was one of the well-known agents of Zillu's-Sultán, told the late Mír-Panj Ja'far-Qulí Khán, the Mu'azzamu'l-Mulk, who was among the respected Kháns of Firaydan, and a high-ranking officer of the old Afváj, of an interview conducted by Zillu's-Sultán in the Chihil-Sutún Pavilion preliminary to these actions. Having summoned the Twin Shining Lights before him, Zillu's-Sultán, with perfect solicitude and kindness, proceeded to admonish and advise them in the following terms: "I do not wish to have you, who are the children of the Prophet, put to death. Merely to silence the Imám-Jum'ih and Shaykh Báqir, do ye declare only 'We are not Bahá'ís.' I will myself then dissuade them from seeking your death; restore all your affairs and assets; and see to it that the utmost love and kindness is observed towards you." With the utmost firmness and steadfastness the two brothers made reply, "To do so would be for us impossible and impermissible." The more the prince insisted, the more the brothers persisted in their refusal. At last he grew angry, and, with all the force he could muster, struck with a boot the head, the face and the mouth of the two brothers, and gave orders for their execution.

So profound an impression did the relation of this occurrence make upon the late Mu'azzamu'l-Mulk that he was guided to embrace the Truth. As a result, a large family accepted the Blessed Cause, forming the nucleus of the believers in Firaydan.

*Photograph of the illumined resting-place of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs*

***2 --*** Áqá Mírzá Ja'far-i-Thábit, who for years pursued in Isfahán the trade of a haberdasher, and afterwards, as a result of the upheaval and tumult, migrated to Tihrán, related the following: "On the day of the martyrdom I, being unaware of what had taken place, happened to pass through the Maydán-i-Sháh. A great multitude had lined its sides, while soldiers had occupied its central space. Upon my asking what was afoot, I was told, 'They have killed two Siyyids who had become Bábís. Their bodies even now lie fallen in the centre of the square.' This announcement that they had killed two Siyyids who were Bábís caused me, despite myself, to become fearfully agitated. I wanted to cry out 'Why have they slain the children of the Prophet!' A person who was standing nearby however took me by the hand, and, with gentle counsels, restrained me from this course. Leading me away from the square, he began to talk with me, explaining what the term 'Bábí' truly signified. In short, having made clear to me the reality of the matter, he was the cause of my becoming a believer."

Of the countless similar occurrences, whereby many souls have been guided to the Truth, the above two instances have remained in my mind.

***Fatal illness of the Imám-Jum'ih: \--*** As is well known throughout the city, a boil appeared on the neck of the Imám-Jum'ih from whose putrid odour all his family members shrank in disgust and loathing. They transported him to the Garden of Shams-Ábád, where he returned to his native abode. It was known that Shaykh Báqir hesitated a little on account of their holy lineage before issuing the death sentence; but the Imám-Jum'ih, who was its principal cause and instigator, clapped his hand upon his neck, exclaiming, "Upon my neck be it (indicating that he would answer for it with his life): the blood of these twain may legitimately be shed."

*Photograph showing several views of the entrance door and the interior of the home of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs*

***Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl: \--*** The other brother of the two martyrs, who resorted to taqíyyih, was the son-in-law of the late Áqá Muhammad-Taqí, son of the late Hájj Mullá Shafí'-i-Khú'í. Belonging as they did to the class of the 'ulamá', when they learned of the two brothers' acceptance of the Blessed Cause they took preventive action to acquit Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl of any such imputation, and obtained from Shaykh Báqir a ruling in this regard, which was reproduced verbatim in the preceding pages.

***The recent litigation: \--*** At the time when the modern judiciary was set up by the late Dávar, the heirs of the late Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl, in order to recover the property held in pledge by the Imám-Jum'ih, and which was in the name of the brothers, brought a suit before the courts of law; but because of the indifference of the legal representatives of the heirs on the one hand, and the excessive influence of the previous possessors of the property on the other, they were content to end the proceedings on the basis of a vain and empty compromise; naught was gained; and the file was recorded as without effect. Before these proceedings too, during the period of despotic rule, the heirs had, at the time of Zillu's-Sultán, brought a case before the Sharí'ah courts and government departments; but the usurpers, apart from having actual possession of the property, stifled the proceedings by paying an exorbitant bribe to Zillu's-Sultán. Since one of the heirs, the late Khánum Siyyid, daughter of Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl, was the wife of Zillu's-Sultán, the prince in truth stood himself indirectly to benefit from the case; but having already obtained his share in the form of a bribe, he chose to overlook the matter. On the day when he ordered the proceedings closed, he threw down before his wife Khánum Siyyid a three-túmán note, saying: "Siyyid Jún, here is a share for thee too."

*Photographs showing (above) the reception room of the house, and (below) the place of confinement of, the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs in Isfahán*

In a blessed talk concerning the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights delivered in Haifa in 1332 A.H. His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- has said.

*His most sweet utterance:*

Zillu's-Sultán told me in Paris, "I wish to explain to thee a certain matter. Prithee give ear unto this account." I replied, "Say on! What harm is there?" He said, "I wish to describe for thee the circumstances of the case of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs." Taking then an oath, he asserted: "This deed was my father's doing. This sin did not originate from me. This transgression is upon my father's head. He wrote to me, 'Bring to thee the brothers and slay them.' I wrote, 'The brothers (that is, the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs) are no ordinary people, that I should bring them hither and slay them. They are eminent and respected citizens of this town. If these be put to death, the people of Isfahán will be greatly perturbed and alarmed. It is not in the interests of the state to slay them.' Again the answer came, 'Questionless thou must slay them.' I wrote, 'This is a very difficult matter. Shouldst thou command it, let me bring them hither and induce them to recant. These are Siyyids, descendants of the Prophet, of unbroken lineage.' A third order arrived: 'Without further recourse, do thou immediately upon receipt of this order bring them to thee and slay them.' First, I sent to them various people with instructions to advise them on my behalf: 'The matter standeth thus. I am acting under duress, and, except ye recant, I have no choice. I will gather the 'ulamá, and bring you before them in a meeting: there do ye announce your recantation. By this means shall I be able to save you from this predicament.' But they would not have it. I was forced to bring them into the government prison. There too I privily sent to them numerous people in order to admonish them, and convey to them on my behalf, 'This is the royal command: it cannot be disregarded. Come now, and announce your recantation: forgo this matter, for otherwise Sháh Bábá will never acquiesce.' Yet still they would not accept. Finally, I myself summoned them at night, and said, 'Áqá Siyyid Husayn, Áqá Siyyid Hasan. This matter hath assumed extremely grave proportions. Sháh Bábá is inflexibly resolved upon your death. There remaineth no expedient at my disposal but to tell the Sháh that ye have recanted. Otherwise, if I do not put you to death, Sháh Bábá will hold me responsible. I do not say that ye should speak evil. Say only, "We are not Bahá'ís," and I will take care of the rest.' They said, 'It is not possible. We are Bahá'ís. Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!' However oft I repeated, 'Áqá Mírzá Husayn, Áqá Mírzá Hasan. They will *kill* you!,' they would not hear me. They said, 'Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!' I did whatever was needful. They utterly refused to accept. The Sháh for his part insisted with the utmost importunity that they should die. I could see that if I did not put them to death, Sháh Bábá would kill me." Such is the story Zillu's-Sultán related to me. He said, "However oft I told them, 'Say only "We are not Bahá'ís,"' they would not have it, but rather repeated, 'Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá! Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!'" *Finis*.

As will have been noted, the two most pure corses of the Twin Shining Lights Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn -- may the peace of God be upon them -- were interred in the Takhtih-Fúlád cemetery. After a while Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, the son of his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, submitted a petition to the Sacred Court of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- requesting leave, should His blessed permission be vouchsafed to this effect, to translate the most pure corses of the twin beatific martyrs from the Takhtih-Fúlád cemetery of Isfahán to the house of the martyrs, which was their place of residence. A Blessed Tablet was revealed in reply, importing that such a measure was not then advisable, and should accordingly be deferred to some future date. The actual wording of this Tablet is as follows.

*His most sweet utterance:*

* He *

*Isfahán. The distinguished scion of him who attained unto the Abhá Kingdom, the Beloved of Martyrs, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious*

He is God

O thou true servant of the Abhá Beauty! Although some time hath passed ere our last exchange of correspondence, yet thine illumined conscience is aware, and doth bear me witness, that no moment have I rested without thinking of thee; and ever have I turned my face unto the Threshold of Oneness, tearfully imploring that thou mightest be under all circumstances a model of servitude unto the Essence of Oneness, and occupied with whatsoever is graceful, lasting and becoming. Praise be to God that thou art assisted and confirmed, and the object of the glances of His loving-kindness.

Thou didst write concerning the translation of the two holy and pure temples from their present location to the frequented fane. Having regard to the need for wisdom, such a measure is not at present permissible, for the people of enmity and rancour lie in ambush, whilst the malevolent lurk in hidden corners. Upon the slightest pretext they would arise to desecrate the sepulchre. Yet in future -- that is, erelong -- it will fall out happily. 'Ayn 'Ayn

In 1322 A.H.S. the Spiritual Assembly of Isfahán, acting upon the instructions of his Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God -- exalted be his praise -- as conveyed by the Sacred National Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Írán, transferred the sanctified mortal remains of the Twin Shining Lights from Takhtih-Fúlád to a place in the vicinity of the grave of the eloquent and renowned teacher of the Cause of God, Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehler. This wondrous spot, situated beside the Záyandih Rúd in a beautiful surrounding filled with trees, verdure and flowers, is today a holy site of visitation for the Friends of God. The grave of the famed teacher lies at but a little distance from the luminous resting-place of the Twin Shining Lights; and only recently the Spiritual Assembly of Isfahán has, at the instance of his Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God, taken the step of transferring also, from the Takhtih-Fúlád cemetery to a place near the tombs of Mrs. Ransom-Kehler and the Twin Shining Lights, the mortal remains of the detached teacher of the Cause of God, Áqá Mírzá Mihdí Ikhvánu's-Safáy-i-Yazdí.

Since the subject has arisen, we shall at this point interpose a few words concerning that famous teacher and paragon of eloquence -- and now possessor of the glorious station of martyrdom -- Mrs. Ransom-Kehler:

The subject (of whose life, for the sake of brevity, no account will here be given), arrived in Írán at the behest of the Guardian, and after she had spent some time in Tihrán and elsewhere meeting with the friends, it was decided that she would journey to Isfahán, and afterwards proceed to Shíráz. The National Assembly accordingly advised the Spiritual Assembly of Isfahán of her impending visit; and on the afternoon of Friday 14 Mihr 1311 A.H.S. she arrived in that city. A fitting reception was held for her by the Spiritual Assembly, to describe all of whose extremely diverse proceedings would be beyond the purview of this notebook. Whilst in Isfahán Mrs. Kehler took ill with the smallpox, and eventually, after having been confined to her sickbed for two weeks, she ascended to the Abhá Kingdom on 2 Ábán 1312 A.H.S. (9 'Ilm 90 B.E. of the Bahá'í calendar, corresponding to 24 October 1933, or 5 Rajab 1352 A.H.) Her body was at first deposited in the Eternal Rose Garden, which was situated in Takhtih-Fúlád; then after a while, when the present location had been made ready, she was translated thither. After her passing a telegram arrived from the Guardian, in which he conferred upon her the rank of martyrdom, including her in the company of the Hands of the Cause of God. Upon her be the forgiveness of God and His Glory.

*Visitation Tablet of the Martyrs*

The honoured Maidservant of God, Rúhá Khánum-i-Mahbúbíy-i-Maghzí wrote to the court of his Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God -- exalted be his sovereignty -- beseeching that a Tablet of Visitation might issue from his blessed pen in honour of the martyrs of Isfahán.

The following blessed directive was issued in response to her petition.

*Isfahán. The Maidservant of God Rúhá Khánum-i-Mahbúbí, upon her be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious*

The petition presented by that maidservant of the Sacred Divine Threshold, dated 16 / 3 / 1312, arrived at the sacred court of our gracious and loving liege, his Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God -- may our souls be a sacrifice for his favours -- and its contents, indicative alike of felicity and spirituality, brought gladness and satisfaction to his blessed being. Thou didst mention the martyrs of the Land of Sád, beseeching that a Tablet of Visitation might issue from his blessed pen. He said: "Write thou: 'Whatsoever hath emanated from the Pen of the Most High, and of the Centre of the Covenant, concerning the martyrs of that land is an inestimable treasure, which the treasuries of heaven and earth can never rival. They are a sufficient bounty and a plenteous bestowal. It is not permissible for a Tablet of Visitation to proceed from the pen of this servant.'" He added: "At times of supplication and devotion in the Holy Shrines, this servant of the Sacred Threshold, with perfect humility and lowliness, beseecheth that the degrees of those sanctified souls may be exalted; while for the survivors of the martyrs I seek from the Threshold of His Holiness, the Lord of mankind, assistance, confirmation, and everlasting happiness." The sheet of delightful verses came too under the gracious and benevolent notice of his most holy being. Again he expressed his kind and loving sentiments towards that attracted and consecrated leaf. Written by his blessed order. Núri'd-Dín Zayn, 15 Núr 90, 19 June 1933

(Written in the Guardian's own hand) "*... May God make thee a sign of bestowal, a standard of victory, and a lamp of guidance among the believing maidservants and the well-assured leaves in that distant clime. The servant of His Threshold, Shoghi*"

*Visitation Tablet in Honour of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs*

*Set then thyself towards the Holy Martyrs' Tombs and the Exalted Shrines,* *and, when thou hast known, hast found, and come before them, stand and say:*

The first light that shone forth from the horizon of the revelation of the Face of your Lord, the Creator of the Heavens, be upon you, O ye the manifestations of fidelity, and the dawning-places of names in the kingdom of creation! I testify that through you the standards of victory have been manifested, the ensigns of guidance have been hoisted, the horizon of steadfastness hath been illumined, and the breeze of God hath been wafted amidst mankind; and through you the glory of sacrifice hath been renewed, and that which hath caused the hearts and minds to marvel hath appeared. It is ye who sacrificed all that ye possessed, your spirits, your every limb and vein, in the path of God, your Well-Beloved and your hearts' Desire. It is ye whom neither the wrong of the oppressor, nor the blame of the blamer, nor the onslaught of every disbeliever who turned away from God when he came invested with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all who are in heaven and on earth, could deter from following in His way. I testify that the Celestial Concourse, and with them the dwellers of the All-Glorious Tabernacle, have bewailed your agony; while on behalf of every believer the Tongue of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, hath spoken: "Verily, we are God's, and unto Him shall we return." In all conditions, praise be to God, the Lord of all that was and shall be.

*Then beseech of God whatsoever thou desirest of His bounty; He, verily, is the All-Glorious, the All-Loving:*

Upon thee be an effulgence of supernal Glory, O thou dayspring of fidelity, from God, the Creator of the Heavens. I testify that through thee the City of Servitude hath been adorned; its standards have been hoisted; its gates have been decked forth; and its songsters have warbled. I testify that thou didst set thy face towards God, and didst speak forth His praise amidst His servants. Blessed art thou, and thy brother, he on whose account the denizens of the Most Sublime Paradise wept sore; and blessed are all who direct themselves towards you; who inhale your fragrance; who follow in your footsteps; and who choose the part of charity towards your kinsfolk now that ye are gone.

*Direct then thy gaze towards Kázim, who won the crown of Supreme Sacrifice in the path of God, the Lord of Mankind, and say:*

Upon thee be the Glory of God, O thou who didst sacrifice thy whole being in the way of God, the Lord of the worlds. The first fragrance that was diffused from the raiment of the mercy of thy Lord, the Possessor of all names, rest upon thee, O thou star shining above the horizon of fidelity, thou who didst ever fix thy gaze upon the Supreme Horizon. I testify that thou didst set thyself towards Him on a Day when every disbeliever had repudiated Him; didst lay hold upon the Book when every infidel had discarded it; didst acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur spake when every gainsayer had denied it; and didst quaff the choice wine of mystic meanings when every hypocrite had forsaken it. Blessed art thou; and the earth that is honoured to enfold thy corse; and the visitor who directeth himself towards thy shrine, and visiteth thy grave; and the one who uttereth thy praise, and proclaimeth that which befell thee during the days of thy Lord. I testify that on thine account the Divine Lote Tree hath lamented, while the hearts of all who, in the days of God, the Possessor of the Throne on high and of Earth below, renounced the world, and turned unto the Supreme Horizon, have melted. Thus hath the Pen spoken in the Spot wherein the King of Eternity is stablished upon His mighty throne. Glory, peace, praise and spirit rest upon thee, thou through whom the tale of Husayn hath been retold, and on whose account the Virgin hath lamented, and the Prophet hath been plunged into conspicuous grief. Fie upon a people who denied thy right, and who cast aside that whereunto they had been commanded by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Glory that appeared and shone forth on that first dawn whereon God revealed Himself unto all the dwellers of His Realm of Glory and of His Heavenly Kingdom, and unto the choicest among His creatures, rest upon thee, O thou King of Fidelity, and My Twin Names Há' and Há'! Of you both doth My Supreme Pen testify that ye turned your faces, and directed yourselves, towards God, the Creator of the Heavens, on a day when the stars fell from heaven, the sun was darkened, the trumpet-blast was sounded, and the mountains flowed. Blessed be whoever directeth himself towards you; attaineth the honour of commemorating you; layeth hold upon the cord of your love; and dissociateth himself from all who, without the authority of any clear proof or Book, rose up against you. The first salutation that was uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur ere the creation of earth and heaven be upon thee, O thou Name Há', thou who shinest above the horizon of fidelity. I testify that thou didst direct thyself towards God; didst hear the Call; didst answer "Yea!" unto the Possessor of all Names; and wast so transported by the rapture born of the Divine Verses that thou didst offer up thine all, thy family and thy spirit, in the path of God, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the Self-Subsisting. *

*Tablet of Visitation*

* He is God *

O My Supreme Pen! Make Thou mention of My Name Hasan, who sacrificed himself in My path, and expended all that he possessed for the love of My beauty, and in his longing to meet Me. Make then mention of My Name Husayn, who returned not from the place of sacrifice. Through them both the tale of the Sacrifice (Ishmael) hath been retold, and all hearts have been consumed. Make then mention of Kázim, who beheld that which none of Thy servants hath beheld. I testify that ye believed in God on the day when commotions seized all the peoples of the earth; when the hearts trembled; and when the eyes stared up in terror. I testify that through you the standards of remembrance have been hoisted among all peoples, and the ensigns of guidance have been planted in most lands. It is ye by reason of whose agony the Divine Lote Tree hath lamented; the Rock (Peter) hath cried out; and the mountains have been scattered in dust. Blessed be whoever draweth nigh unto you; is honoured to visit you; and uttereth that which the Pen of the Most High hath spoken in your remembrance and praise, and concerning all that ye were in the love of God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End.

*Tablet of Visitation for the Martyrs of the Land of Sád*

*Do thou, O My Name, who gazest upon My Countenance, when thou beholdest the whiteness of the city wherein the Sun of Fidelity hath set, halt, and say:*

O Land of Sád! Where are the dawning-places of thy light, and the daysprings of thy glory? Where is the adornment of thy temple, and where they through whom the horizon of guidance was illumined amongst Thy creatures? Where are the letters of the Book of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised? O Land of Sád! Where are thy standards and thy signs? Where thy clear tokens, thine ensigns? Have the evidences of tyranny in thee been erased, or doth it continue as of yore? Tell me, nor be of them that hold their peace! Doth the She-Serpent hiss in thee, and doth the Wolf howl as he howled aforetime? Thy Lord, verily, asketh, and Himself maketh reply. He, verily, is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. We testify that in thee the treasures of fidelity have been laid up; the Crimson Ark hath foundered; and the She-Camel of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath been hamstrung. The suns of love and fidelity have vanished from thine horizons by reason of that which the hands of those who disbelieved in God, the Gracious, the Most High, have wrought. Say: O Land of Sád! We, verily, commend unto thy care My trust, nay rather My trusts. We ask thee of the flame of hatred: hath its blazing and raging been extinguished? Tell me truly for the sake of God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne!

*O My Name, O thou who speakest forth My praise! Know thou that it behoveth whosoever wisheth to be illumined by the light of immortality, and to attain the honour of visiting one of the people of Bahá', who are established upon the Crimson Ark, and have turned their faces unto the Supreme Horizon, to purify his heart with the water of detachment; to sanctify his countenance from turning unto whatsoever hath been created in the universe, or fashioned in the realm of God's invention; and to be in such a state of consecration that the Kingdom shall be before his face, and all else save God in his rear. Let him then walk with the dignity of God, and His tranquillity, and, with every step he taketh, say with quintessential lowliness and unsurpassed humility:*

O my God! I have purposed to visit them whose blood was spilled in Thy path, and who laid down their lives in Thy love.

*So let him continue until he reacheth the Most Holy Tomb and the Sanctified Dust; let him then halt, and, having gazed to the right, as one might gaze who awaited the mercy of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, turn unto the burial place, and say:*

The first harbinger of salvation that shone forth from the horizon of bounty; and the first fragrance that wafted from the raiment of the Revealer of His Holiness the Lord of Eternity; and the first remembrance that was uttered in the world by the Tongue of the Primal Will; and the first light whereby the hearts of the nations were enraptured, be upon you, O ye the temples of praise, the dawning-places of names, and the daysprings of God's Command in the kingdom of creation. I testify that because of you the All-Merciful mounted the throne of this contingent world; the ocean of forgiveness surged; the stream of living water overflowed; the kingdom of utterance appeared; and the sun of knowledge shone resplendent above the horizon. Ye it is through whose allegiance the Primal Will and its sovereignty have been made manifest; and the Primal Purpose and its potency, and the Primal Destiny and whatsoever hath been decreed therein by God, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, have been disclosed. Through you the Word hath encompassed all; the breeze hath wafted; and mankind hath been illumined by the splendours of a Light that rose and shone forth from the Dayspring of God's Light. Through you, verily, the Dove of Fidelity hath warbled in the Most Sublime Paradise; the Sadratu'l-Muntahá hath spoken; the Nightingale of Bahá' hath poured forth its song; and all things have cried out proclaiming that whereunto God Himself hath testified, He Who is your Maker, your Fashioner, your King, your Origin, your Creator, your Quickener, your Slayer, your Beginning, your End, your Manifester, your Inspirer, your Confirmer, and the Blazoner of your names. Ye are the letters of the Primal Word, the first adornment in the kingdom of creation, and the manifestations of justice in the Most Exalted Realm of Glory. Ye are the Written Book, the Illustrious Symbol, the Outspread Roll, the Frequented Fane. Through you the ensigns of justice have been hoisted, and the standards of victory planted; and through you the fragrance of the Divine raiment hath been wafted, and the sign of sanctity made manifest. Through you the gates of bounty have been flung open before the nations, and the loving-kindness of the All-Merciful hath rained down from the heaven of understanding. Blessed are ye; and all who seek through you to draw nigh unto God; and all who lay fast hold upon the hem of your garment, cleave tenaciously unto your cord, and speak forth your praise. Woe unto all such as deny your right, turn away from you, show pride towards you, and dispute the Divine providence manifested in you. All things testify unto your glory, the exaltation of your station, and the gain ye have secured both in this world and in the next; likewise unto the loss of those who disbelieved in God when he came with resplendent signs, clear tokens and effulgent lights. Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose Name they who adore Thy unity have soared into the atmosphere of Thy nearness and Thy presence, and they who are devoted to Thee have hastened unto the place of sacrifice for love of Thee, and for the sake of Thy pleasure. I ask Thee, by them who have suffered martyrdom in Thy path, and who were so transported by the rapture born of Thy Divine Verses that naught on earth could prevent them from drawing nigh unto Thee, to write down for us with Thy Pen of Glory that which will profit us both in this world and in the next. O my God, my Master, and my Hope! I ask thee by this purest dust, and by this sacred tomb, to forgive me, and to pardon my grievous trespasses. Do Thou ordain for me, by Thy grace, that whereby mine eye shall be gladdened, and my breast dilated. Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. In Thy grasp are the keys of mercy and salvation. There is no God but Thee, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Almighty.

A Tablet of Visitation was also revealed by the pen of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- in honour of the Twin Shining Lights, and of Áqá Mírzá Mihdí Ikhvánu's-Safá, who was subsequently buried in the vicinity of the resting-place of the Twin Shining Lights.

The wording of the Blessed Tablet of Visitation is as follows.

*His most sweet utterance:*

O friends! Do ye on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Bahá go one day especially to visit that luminous spot, and recite these words: "The glory shining from the apex of exaltation, and the light beaming from the Concourse on High, descend upon, and surround, that luminous spot, wherein lie buried those stars of radiant splendour, the twin glistening lights in the Abhá Kingdom; and the refulgent lamp in the globe of piety, and detached spirit guiding unto the way of truth. I testify that ye are the signs of guidance amidst mankind, the ensigns of the Abhá Kingdom, and the kings of the throne of supreme bestowal. Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye attained this most sublime station, and loftiest pinnacle, and were raised up by God unto an exalted station of truth. I, verily, seek the blessing of this perfumed dust and fragrant musk, for it formeth the resting-places of those well-assured and contented souls who are nigh unto the Lord of mankind. I ask God to make your graves niches of light in this perspicuous age and glorious century -- my Lord doth, verily, single out for His mercy whomsoever He willeth -- in order that the sincere may derive therefrom illumination, and the visitors inhale therefrom the breaths of flowers." The Glory of Glories rest upon you. 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás

*Blessed Tablet in Honour of the Beloved of Martyrs***

He is the Glorious, the Most Glorious

O thou Name of God! Hearken unto the sweet melodies of the Spirit, and take no heed of them who have disbelieved in God and His Verses, and who have turned against His Cause. Follow thou the Faith of the Spirit in the love of thy Lord: this is the root of religion, though none shall know it save all that are well-assured and discern aright. Say: O people! The veils of idle fancy have been torn away; the heaven of impiety hath been cleft asunder; and God hath come down upon the cloud of holiness, surrounded by a host of angels. Thereupon all things were changed; every soul was shaken; and every proud and lofty peak was reduced in dust. Remain thou steadfast in the Cause through the power of God and His might; and assume thou in this state a seat of conspicuous glory. Assist then the Cause to the extent that thou art able, for the people of the Bayán would fain return the Cause unto the abyss where they themselves are fallen. Lay hold upon the reins of the Cause lest the fingers of impiety profane it: this is that which hath been destined for thee in His glorious and preserved Tablets. We have decreed that every soul should write touching this Cause that whereby the feet of them who are endued with understanding shall be confirmed in an exalted honour. O Khalíl! Shatter thou the idols of imagination through the power of thy Lord; then lead out the people from the darkness of passion, and usher them into an abode of safety beneath the shadow of the Divine Lote Tree that hath sprung up in truth from beside a mighty throne. Beware lest aught distract thee; do thou of thine own accord draw nigh unto God, Who created thee, fashioned thee, and appointed thee to be a glorious remembrance unto His servants. Shouldst thou wish to learn what hath touched the Beauty of an Effulgent Glory, know that He hath fallen into the well of envy: here is His raiment, bespattered with His blood, which we have sent unto thee that thou mayest have clear proof of Our claim. Thus have we inspired thee, and revealed unto thee what befell the Manifestation of the Self of God at the hands of His servants who, though created by a mere indication of His purpose, as articulated by His pen, dealt frowardly towards their Lord. Be thou the Word of God, and the Sword of His Command among His servants, that through thee He may distinguish between those who believed in God and His Verses, and those who disbelieved and rebelled against the Cause. Take heed that thou aid thy Lord at all times, and approach not those from whom thou inhalest the odour of animosity towards this Youth, Who hath shone forth above the Dawning-place of Eternity with manifest dominion. Say: O people! If ye believed in 'Alí because of the revelation to Him of the Bayán; and before Him in Muhammad because of the revelation to Him of the Furqán; and again in the One Who conversed with God (Moses) because of the revelation to Him of the Torah, then by the righteousness of God these are their selfsame Verses, which, in this peerless form, have been sent down from the throne on high. These apart, the whole earth hath been filled with the evidences of a sovereignty that hath encompassed all the worlds. Be ye then abashed, O people, before God, Who created you by His command; and repent ye for having failed in your duty towards Him -- a duty that is owed here, did ye but know it. Say: Blind are the eyes that will not turn towards His court; and mute is the tongue that will not celebrate the wonders of His praise; and deaf are the ears that will not hearken unto the sweet melodies of the Spirit uttered by this tongue, which proclaimeth in all things: "I, in very truth, am God: no God is there but Him; His knowledge, truly, embraceth all things." Say: O people! Cast away that which ye possess. Take hold, then, of the Tablet of God with a power born of Him, and inhale its savour: should ye discover therefrom the fragrance of the All-Merciful, guard it from the blight of demons. Then assist Him so far as lieth in your power: He, verily, assisteth His loved ones as He pleaseth; and verily His assistance is nigh unto the believers. Beware that ye dispute not with God; nor contend with the One Who is His own Self; nor repudiate that whereby your names shall be exalted, and the truth of your own religion hath been established. Fear God, and be not distant from the shore of nearness. The Spirit be upon thee, and upon all who follow thy Lord's command at even and at morn. It is complete: revealed a second time from the Abhá Kingdom by Our Name Há'.

*Blessed Tablet in Honour of the King of Martyrs*

He is the Glorious, the Most Glorious

From the Burning Bush beyond the Radiant City upon the hallowed Spot of God's Command, the Mystery of God hath, by the power of the spirit, been witnessed, and speaketh in truth saying: "O people of the Bayán! Have ye disbelieved in the One through Whom ye believed in God aforetime? Here is My Beauty, which hath been revealed through His grace; yet have ye allowed them that are the manifestations of names in the kingdom of creation to shut you out therefrom; notwithstanding that they were all created by His Word. He, verily, is powerful over all things." O Most Great Name! We, verily, have made thee to be among the greatest of names, that thou mayest issue forth from the abode of silence, and rise above the dawning-place of utterance to proclaim a Cause that hath encompassed all worlds. Unloose therefore thy tongue in truth, and announce unto the people that whereof, by the power of the Spirit, He hath informed thee in this Tablet, which was sent down from the right hand of the throne. Beware lest aught deter thee from commemorating thy Lord. Burn away the veils of sorrows through the Name of thy Lord, the God of Mercy; then shine forth above the horizon of remembrance with a perspicuous light. Beware lest thou forget the occasion when thou didst enter into the Beatific Spot, and didst come before the throne; when We cheered thee with tidings of all good, and ordained for thee on earth an exalted station. Break not the Covenant thou didst enter into before God, neither violate His Testament, but be steadfastly loyal to thine undertaking. Be constant in thy love for thy Lord: beware lest thou withhold thyself from that which We have destined for thee, that thou mayest be reckoned in the Mother Tablet among such as are well grounded in their belief. Write then in vindication of this Cause whatsoever the Spirit infuseth into thy breast; He, verily, will inspire thee with the truth, and assist thee in a matter whose outcome hath been predetermined by the Pen of God. Spirit, Honour and Glory be upon thee, and upon those who are with thee at the dawning of the Cause; at the eventide of holiness; and at every moment. To be delivered unto Al-Hasan An-Nahrí of the dwellers of Sád, that he may be of them that do good.

*In the Name of God, the Exalted, in His All-Highest Station*

O thou Letter of Fidelity! Thy missive hath arrived before Us; I am cognizant of all thou didst write therein; and We have accepted thine expressions of love for God, for the Manifestations of His Self, and the Mirrors of His Being. Erelong shall God requite thee with a most excellent reward from Him, and shall cause thy name to be recorded in the Book of the Spirit among the rightly guided. Even now doth He exhort thee with the counsels of eternity, and assist thee in words of holiness to grasp the essence of the Cause, that thou mayest inhale the fragrances of Paradise wafting from the Beauteous City, and abide with Divine honour in the Immortal Garden for evermore. Exercise discernment in thine affairs; defame no one; follow not thy passions; and place thy trust in God, thy Lord. Walk then upon the earth with a dignity born of God; shun those in whose hearts thou perceivest resentment towards God and His loved ones; and enter not into disputation with the unbelievers. Shouldst thou act as We have inspired thee, thou shalt discover on earth a prosperity vouchsafed of God; and in the world to come a yet goodlier station and more excellent estate. Thus have We revealed unto thee the Word of Truth; taught thee the paths of guidance; and made known unto thee the ways of godliness, that thou mayest discern clearly the nature of the Cause. Say: O people! Fear God, and follow not the steps of demons. Believe ye all that God hath sent down unto you; then follow whatsoever this Servant imparteth unto you of the sweet melodies of eternity, that ye may be of them that champion the Cause in thronéd heights. Relate unto thy heart this vision touching all that We have unveiled to thee of the mysteries of destiny from beyond the Crimson City. Thus hath God's sentence been irrevocably passed upon all people. Rejoice then in thy spirit inasmuch as We have answered thee, and made mention of thee, in this Tablet, and ordained for thee a great glad tidings on the part of God. Revealed from the Há' after the Bá', Yá Hasan!

*Blessed Tablet Revealed in Honour of the King of Martyrs*

He is God

Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! O my God! Verily, this is Thy servant who hath been carried away by the heat of Thy love and the transports of Thy devotion, and upon whom have wafted the breaths of Thy holiness and the melodies of Thy spirit. Such was the exultation at Thy beauty, and the ecstasy at Thy glory, engendered in his heart that he became detached from all things and from the suggestions of all people; until he journeyed through Thee unto Thee, and emigrated from Thee even unto Thyself. The way was barred until he entered the paths of Thy loving-kindness. It was as though he walked in his own person, so great was his yearning to meet Thee; that he might arrive at the gate of the City of Thy Oneness, and attain the glorious seats of Thine Eternity. At length he stood before the Tabernacles of Thine Exaltation and the Canopy of Thy Majesty in the Habitation of Holiness in the shelter of the Sanctuary of Thy Grandeur, the Garden of Thy Beauty and the City of Thy Guidance; and attained, through that surpassing honour and superlative distinction, unto a state wherein the cord of his servitude was strengthened by the fibre of Thy Lordship, and the lamp of his poverty was kindled by the wicks of Thy riches. Thereupon he entered into the depths of the oceans of the Divine Essence before the surging of the Verses of Thy glorious sovereignty. Unto Thee be praise, therefore, O my God, for whatsoever Thou hast bestowed upon him by Thy bounty, and honoured him withal by Thy power; and unto Thee be thanks for all Thou hast sustained him withal of the gems of hidden favours, and the wonders of his treasured mercy, which have come to fruition upon the trees of love in the inmost realities of hearts. I ask Thee, then, O my God, to cause him to hearken unto the call of this Firebird in this Abhá Paradise, that with his whole being he may come forth for the sake of establishing Thy victory in the kingdom of Thy creation and in the dominion of Thy glory; and that his spirit may be purified from all that hath not been ordained by Thy decree, nor enjoyeth the sanction of Thy good pleasure: forasmuch as Thou holdest in Thy hands the reins of all things. Thou, verily, art the Revealer of the Revelation, Who singest upon the supernal Light within the Sinaitic Tree; and Thou, indeed, hast power over all things. Bless Thou, O Lord my God, Thy First Light whereby the spirits of Thy sacred eternality have soared aloft; and bless Thou moreover Thy Mansion that moveth upon the air in the very axis of the sun, the centre of Thine appointment at Thy pleasure by Thy decree; and all those that guide thereunto in the lofty heights of eternity, and in the bowers of the invisible realm. Thou, truly, art the Ordainer, the All-Compelling, the All-Conquering, the All-Knowing, the Ever-Living, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Powerful, the All-Informed. Array then with a robe of blessing woven of the cotton of immortality the temple of him who is thy brother in the world of being; and convey from me to him a salutation from the pages of fidelity; likewise to all that are about thee of the people of guidance. 251, The Land of Sád, Há' Sín-Yá' Nún

*Blessed Tablet Revealed in Honour of the King of Martyrs*

He is God, the Almighty, All-Powerful

In these days it is natural that selfish passions should have prevented some from observing justice and equity, and whatsoever hath been sent down in the Tablets concerning unity and harmony. Even so, what is the Pen of the Most High to say, and to whose behoof should the Tongue of Knowledge speak? The ignorance of God's creatures hath darkened the resplendent horizon of knowledge; the heedlessness of the people hath veiled the radiant dawn of guidance. In most of the Divinely-revealed Tablets We have enjoined upon all wisdom, unity, laudable deeds and a praiseworthy character. Though all have read these, and become aware of the Divine precepts, yet have they remained far distant from the Straight Path, and given precedence rather to their own desires. We have enjoined upon them unity; rather have they risen up in strife. We have summoned them unto wisdom; rather have they shown forth the reverse. In most of the Tablets they have been forbidden to direct themselves towards the Divine Court; this notwithstanding, each day a host arriveth and another host departeth. There is no power nor strength except in God! Ye have heard of the developments in the Land of Tá', and the determination of some to commit a heinous act. We have commanded all souls to set the world in order; rather have they occupied themselves with sowing strife. Methinks they have regarded the Divine commands as of no account, and considered the Lordly precepts as mere fancies. They speak as passion moveth them, then attribute what they say unto the One True God. He, verily, is clear of those who have wrought mischief in the land after it had been set in order, and who speak that which hath been forbidden them in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. Please God, in training certain weak souls, and in promoting concord and union, thou must, so far as thou art able, exert an unremitting effort, that haply they may attain unto that which God hath purposed. The sorrow of this Wronged One is clear and manifest from this Tablet. Verily, we are God's, and unto Him shall we return. 251, Sád, Há' Sín Nún

*Blessed Tablet of the Most Holy Abhá Beauty in Honour of the King of Martyrs, Containing an Exhortation to Teach the Cause*

*His honour Há' before Sín, upon him be the Glory of God*

In the Name of Him Who speaketh with unerring wisdom

Há' Sín. Praise be to God, thou didst inhale the fragrance of the Divine raiment, and it guided thee unto the dawning-place of the Hidden Secret, and the dayspring of the Well-guarded Treasure: wherefore at length, on the wings of yearning and devotion, of rapture and attraction, thou didst set out to reach the Most Exalted Destination, traversing prairies, deserts, seas and mountains, until thou didst attain the Furthermost Bourne, and the Spot around which the Concourse on High circle in adoration. No station equalleth this station: thereto have testified the Books of God aforetime and hereafter, and withal this perspicuous and mighty Tablet. Thy letters were received, and all were graced with an attentive hearing. Praise be to God, thou art occupied in remembrance of Him Who is the Beloved of the World, and steadfast in service to the Cause. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of sanctity that this utterance, which hath risen above the dayspring of the Pen of the All-Merciful, shall never be blotted out from the pages of the world. Do thou recognize its station, and be of the thankful. Please God, those souls who have fixed their gaze upon the Most Sublime Horizon, and laid fast hold upon the hem of the mercy of the Incomparable Friend, should, in teaching the Divine Cause, do so both with wisdom and with utterance. All matters today are dependent upon wisdom. Should wisdom not dictate it, it is not permitted to speak. All must cleave unto such matters as are conducive to the assurance and tranquillity of the people, for by reason of the clamour of the heedless the hearts of the weak are like to be sore shaken. Thy Lord, verily, is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Blessed is the one who aideth his Lord with goodly deeds and a spiritual character; he, truly, is reckoned among the people of Bahá' in the Crimson Book, wherein the Pen of the Most High hath inscribed the secrets of all that hath been and shall be. Wondrous and incomparable Verses have been sent down especially for thee. Please God, thou mayest attain unto them all, and, with perfect wisdom and eloquence, engage in service to the Cause -- service such as will be permanent and lasting, to the degree that the evanescence of the world and all its vicissitudes shall never change it. Teaching is the Divine command, provided it be undertaken with wisdom. He, verily, speaketh the truth; leadeth the way; and revealeth the proof. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Beauteous. 251

These pearl-like words were revealed from the Pen of the Ancient Beauty for his honour Há' and Sín.

*His exalted Utterance:*

O Há' before Sín! The Greater Branch hath come into Our presence, and spoken in praise of thee. I beseech the One True God to assist thee in that which shall be the means and cause of the continuation of thine existence. Praise be to God, thou hast quaffed of the life-giving waters that have flowed out from the Pen of the All-Merciful, and hast hearkened unto the rustling of the leaves of the Divine Lote Tree. This mention of thee, and this loving-kindness, shall abide and endure so long as the Kingdom of God shall endure. Erelong shall there be made manifest all that hath flowed forth from the Pen of the Most High. We ask God to aid thee in preserving this most exalted station; He, verily, is the Almighty, the Ancient of Days. Under all conditions thy name hath been, and is, remembered. This is a token of thy Lord's bounty unto thee. *Finis*.

The following Blessed Tablet was revealed by the Pen of the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- in honour of the King of Martyrs ere the latter's martyrdom.

*His exalted Utterance:*

In the Name of the All-Knowing Expounder. The ocean of true knowledge streaming from the dayspring of the mouth of the Will of Him Who is the All-Merciful hath revealed its splendour in the form of these words. The clouds of the idle fancies of the ignorant have made dark and gloomy the world's luminous horizon; while the tyranny of the rulers hath rendered turbid the clear fount of tranquillity. Yet the day is approaching when the Divine decrees will have penetrated these intervening veils, and dissipated these various impediments and obstacles. Say: O friends! What need is there for consternation, what cause for fear? Never hath there been, nor is there now, any doubt that all who are endowed with spirit shall one day be overtaken, and seized upon, by death. Such being the case, if this death be converted into martyrdom, and take place in the path of God, it would assuredly be preferable. Every intelligent and thinking person will testify that this station hath ever been, and ever shall be, the loftiest of all stations. All men are commanded to observe wisdom, and forbidden to engage in mischief, strife and contention; yet should aught befall, then with perfect resignation must they direct their steps unto the scene of sacrifice in the path of the Incomparable Friend. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of sanctity! Should a soul quaff from the cup of knowledge the crystal waters of the love of the All-Merciful, never would he be moved by the wrong of the oppressor and the onslaught of the tyrant even to sadness, how much less to fear and consternation! Please God, thou wilt acquaint all the wayfarers in the Straight Path with that which hath been sent down in this Tablet from the Pen of the All-Merciful, so that, with the utmost joy and gladness, they may be occupied with the remembrance of Him Who is the Lord of all men. Say: The Pen of the Most High affirmeth: the death of each soul is predetermined in the Book of God, neither shall it be advanced or delayed by a single moment. Is it then seemly that the lover should shrink from meeting his Beloved, or be sorrowed by the prospect of laying down his life in the pathway of the Adored One? Nay, by Myself, the True One! And yet the people for the most part apprehend it not. Say: Sanctify and purify the hearts, that they may discover a window giving onto the Most Great Ocean: thereafter neither the hosts of the world, nor the clamours of the champions of the nations, shall have the power to keep such souls back from Him Who is the King of Eternity. Do thou then beseech God graciously to confirm and assist them in such wise that they may soar up on the wings of longing unto God, the Supreme King, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We, verily, have made mention of thee aforetime, and in this wondrous Tablet, that thou mayest be well assured of the grace of thy Lord, and mayest relate unto the people that which hath proceeded from His Most Holy, His All-Glorious, and His Most Exalted Pen. The Glory of God rest upon thee, and upon all those who have held fast unto the commandments of God, the Lord of all worlds.

Tablets Revealed after the Ascension

Of the Twin Shining Lights

In the Name of Other believers

Concerning the Station of the Martyrs of Isfahán

*Tá', His honour Zaynu'l-'Ábidín, who attained unto Thee*

He is the Most Holy, the Most Mighty, the Witness, the Seer, the All-Informed

A remembrance from Us unto him who attained the presence of this Wronged One when He was fallen into the hands of the heedless. I bear witness that he set out from his home, proceeding in the direction of the Frequented Fane and Blessed Station which the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Furqán, and attained unto that which he desired on the Day of God, the Lord of the worlds. The servant in attendance is at hand, and hath recited once again thy letter as a bounty on the part of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Blessed be thy tongue for telling forth that which hath befallen the Daystar of Bathá (Mecca), for whom the Celestial Concourse, and the inmates of Paradise in their noble habitation, have lamented. Blessed is he who extolleth the names of Há' and Há', and thereafter of him that was named Kázim, who laid down his life in the way of God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. I testify that neither martial hosts, nor the clamour of every wayward cleric, overawed him. By My life! We, verily, found him steadfast in the Cause of his Lord, in such wise that the inmates of Paradise, and those who circle the throne as bidden by Him Who is the All-Glorious, the Most Great, were filled with wonder. Erelong shall God reveal unto him that which hath been hidden from the face of His servants; He, verily is the Incomparable, the All-Knowing. By the righteousness of God! They attained that which none had previously attained; thereto testifieth My Pen of Glory in this wondrous Tablet. From this Spot We salute thee, and all those who have attained unto the choice wine of steadfastness in this Cause, whereby the hearts of the learned have trembled, and the feet of the wise have slipped.

*To be favoured by the purest and most luminous glances of the respected and revered Afnán, his honour Áqá Siyyid Mím -- upon him be of all glories the Most Glorious*

In the Name of the One All-Seeing, All-Knowing God

The quintessence of glorification and praise beseemeth that Ancient King and Possessor of the world Who, through but a single effulgence of the resplendent lights of His beauty, seated Abraham amid the fire, and sent Ishmael unto the place of sacrifice. The mind is perplexed to conceive what the nature of this effulgence might be. If it fall upon a sovereign he giveth up his kingdom; if it shed its splendour upon a complete pauper, he becometh contemptuous of the world of riches; and if it turn upon the embodiment of riches, he forgoeth his station, and standeth in the ranks of servants, ready to offer service. I swear by the ocean of Divine knowledge that were He to make manifest that which He hath concealed, thou wouldst see the whole world turn into Abrahams, and into the Ishmaels of the age; howbeit this company of Abrahams would not consent unto the transmutation of the fire; neither would this company of Ishmaels return from the place of sacrifice. This evanescent servant is at a loss what to say, and what to represent. He is at once bewildered and forbidden to speak. Such being the case, he can but cling unto the cord of "Increase my bewilderment in Thee!" Gracious God! A single Call at once bringeth intoxication and bestoweth clarity of thought! It at once bringeth forgetfulness and conferreth the knowledge of all things! Would I were permitted to recount what I have seen and known! The matter lieth solely in His hand; unto none belongeth any station, jurisdiction, power, or strength save by His leave and His bounty. May my spirit be a ransom for thy remembrance, and a sacrifice for thine arising. In the days when the Mansion had become the Most Sublime Vision, his honour the Name of God Mím Há' -- upon him be of all glories the Most Glorious -- arrived one day at sunset, and attained unto the Most Holy Court. Thereafter he handed to this servant an envelope containing both thine own distinguished autograph and the letter from his honour Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl. That same evening, circumstances so demanded that this servant found occasion to present their whole contents before the Countenance of the Ancient Beauty; and when the recitation was complete He arose from His seat, began to pace, and said: "O My Afnán! Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have been favoured with the loving-kindness of your Lord, and been honoured to recognize Him, and to turn towards Him; and blessed are they that love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. We, verily, have exalted your stations. Erelong shall ye behold them: to this will testify whoso turneth towards My Face, recognizeth My Most Mighty Cause, and hasteneth unto My Straight Path. O My Afnán, in most of the Tablets mention hath been made of the greatness of the Cause. By the righteousness of God! Greater is it than every great thing! Were anyone to reflect upon the stations of that soul who, in this day, is graciously aided to recognize the Cause of God, he would in general become acquainted with the greatness of the Cause. Thy Lord, truly, unlocketh the door of understanding before the face of whom He will; He, verily, is the Supreme Ordainer, the All-Knowing. O My Afnán! The loving-kindness of the One True God hath been, and evermore shall be, with you. Consider ye this utterance that shone forth from the Dayspring of the Revelation of the All-Merciful unto one of those who had turned their faces towards Him. 'O Husayn, cleave thou unto this blessed Word, which is even as an ark upon the ocean of the knowledge of Him Who is the King of creation. Although this Word is ancient -- meaning that the Manifestations of the Cause spake it of old -- yet today is it made manifest in a wondrous new attire, inasmuch as the true Isráfíl hath breathed a fresh spirit of meaning into the temples of words. It is this: "Whoso is for God, God is for him." Shouldst thou voyage upon this ocean, thou wouldst behold thyself endowed with a new spirit and a boundless assurance; wouldst soar on the wings of ardent longing into the atmosphere of the love of Him Who is the Daystar of the world; and wouldst, with perfect joy, gladness and contentment, walk upon this straight path of justice.' O Afnán! Ye have turned unto the True One -- meaning that ye have been assisted by His grace to attain unto this station -- and the True One likewise, with the utmost loving-kindness, turneth unto you. Let it not be imagined that the fruits of this loving-kindness shall remain hidden. Nay, by Mine own Self! Erelong shall God make them manifest on earth: He, verily, is your Friend and your Helper; He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. These are the days of the Revelation, and the grace vouchsafed is boundless. He, verily, is the Most Gracious; He, verily, is the Most Bountiful; He, verily, is the Most Generous. Under all conditions have ye regard for wisdom, and put your reliance in the True One. In His hand is the preservation of all things; He, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Powerful. The Glory of God rest upon you, and upon whoso loveth you, and upon whoso setteth his face towards you, and hearkeneth unto your call and your remembrance. He, verily, is of them that have won the gracious favour of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise." Finis.

As for what thou didst write concerning his honour Mírzá Ismá'íl, his letter was presented in its entirety. He said: "In some of what he hath mentioned he is right. He should be treated with kindliness and forbearance." A most sublime and holy Tablet was also revealed especially for him from the firmament of Grace, and despatched hence. Do thou o'erlook it, and send it on. Our Lord, truly, is the Ordainer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The aforenamed Mírzá hath however fallen into great perplexity. Although he is right in asserting that the Cause is great, inasmuch as it is related unto God, yet were he to immerse himself a while in the ocean of awareness he would perceive that it is, and ever shall be, the finest, the greatest, the truest, the most perfect, and the most exalted of all matters in the world. At the time when this evanescent servant was in 'Iráq, the martyred Twin Shining Lights set out for Zawrá' (Baghdád) with the purpose of visiting the Divine Kaaba. On their return from the Land of Taff (Karbilá) they attained unto the Most Holy Court; and, after hearkening unto the Call of God, they underwent in reality a transformation. The loving-kindness shown towards them, unknown as they were amongst the people, was so remarkable that some were astonished at it, and marvelled greatly. Thereafter they, pursuant to the Divine behest, returned again to their own land; the Hand of Divine power raised them up and arrayed them with the robe of honour; and from the cloud of bounty blessings rained down upon them, until they became known and celebrated throughout the world in the name of the Ancient King, and in truth He established their place firmly in the hearts, even as thou hast seen and dost now witness. Subsequent to their return to the Land of Sád, two letters came from them to the Most Holy Court, and likewise other letters. Therein, with utmost lowliness and ardour, they craved, and expressed the hope of attaining, the very station which afterwards they won. What greater bounty is there than this, that, praise be to God, in the nether world they were identified with the name of the True One, it being observed that even the ungodly behaved with deference in their presence; while at the end of their days they attained a station whose description is beyond aught that the pen of this servant could compass, or the tongue of this evanescent one express? From the Tablets that have come down from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of all men concerning this supreme calamity, the full measure of this station may be known and ascertained. O beloved of mine heart! A hundred thousand blessings be theirs, and a hundred thousand regrets the portion of this servant! Methinks, with the tongues of the whole world he exclaimeth at all times: "Would I had been with them!" Observe thou that the Prince of the World was martyred under the circumstances that have reached thy blessed ears, while these are accounted among His servants. Yet observably the effect of their martyrdom is greater, its influence more complete, and its pain more searing. Exalted be He Who raised them up. Exalted be He Who honoured them. Exalted be He Who caused them to win this station, in striving after which God's chosen ones have offered up their lives.

I swear by the Beloved of the world that never shall his regret on this account fade from the heart of this servant. I ask Him, exalted is He, graciously to assist me to do His will and pleasure. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Powerful. As for your having referred matters unto the True One, and committed them to His care, in this regard He said: "They, indeed, have done well! Their Lord, the God of Mercy, is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He revealeth whatsoever He pleaseth by virtue of His sovereignty. He, verily, is the One Whom naught can frustrate; Whom martial hosts cannot affright; and Whom neither the tyranny of the mighty nor the ascendancy of the powerful can weaken. He, verily, ordaineth what He willeth, and doeth as He pleaseth." Finis.

Another Tablet was graciously revealed in honour of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs.

That which hath been witnessed in this Most Great Revelation is such that no room for doubt or misgiving hath been, or is now, left for anyone, save those who are actuated by perversity and speak with complete and palpable injustice. Whatsoever was revealed beforehand in the Divine Tablets touching subsequent events hath been set forth explicitly and without allusion. Should anyone look into the Tablets of Fu'ád and Ra'ís, the Lawh-i-Párís, and the rest of the Tablets that were revealed amid the rigours of the Prison and the subsequent opening of its gates, he would be filled with wonder and amazement. Letter by letter everything hath come to pass. After the revelation of each of these Tablets, the hearts of some, though well assured, were yet astonished to conceive how these matters could come about. This servant was wont to observe, "They shall see." One day this servant inquired, "Were the Chief to repent, might he be graced with the robe of forgiveness?" Thereupon the Countenance of the Ancient of Days turned towards me, and He said: "I swear by God, besides Whom there is none other God! All that the Most Merciful hath sent down in the Tablet shall come to pass." Then, in the Persian tongue He affirmed: "Should all the powers of heaven and earth combine with the purpose of altering one single letter of the Lawh-i-Ra'ís, they have never been, nor ever shall be, able to accomplish this." Were anyone to see that Tablet, and to learn of the disasters that befell the Chief, his followers and his lands, assuredly he would cry out betwixt earth and heaven in the name of God, our Exalted and Most Glorious Lord. The people are fast asleep: truly they are sunk in slumber, and in this state shall they remain until such time as they themselves perceive their own levels of the Abyss, meaning their own stations. He likewise bade me, "Write thou unto the Afnán: 'O Afnán! Be not sorrowed by the happenings of the world. From the clouds of His favour, and the heaven of His generosity He bestoweth His bounty as is requisite. If in this supreme calamity some suffer injury or detriment, there hath not been, nor is there now, any harm in this. He, verily, is the Great Giver, the Generous. He bestoweth now as He hath done in the past. If in certain cases a delay occurreth, it is in view of a surpassing wisdom. He, verily, knoweth what shall appear, and within His grasp are held the reins of all things; He, verily, is the Great Giver, the Ever-Forgiving.'" As for the circumstance, related in thy letter, that thou didst write to his honour Áqá Siyyid Ahmad the Afnán -- upon him be of all glories the Most Glorious -- advising him to donate to the expenses of the survivors of the wronged martyr -- upon him be the Light of God and His mercy -- first and foremost, this matter ranketh above all others in the sight of the One True God -- exalted be His glory; yet should it be put into effect only after cognizance is taken of their affairs, and exact information acquired of their circumstances. For if aught be done in secret, and his honour Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl become apprised thereof, this would assuredly cast him into despair, and perchance occasion ill-feeling between him and the survivors. Thy solicitude for them is greatly beloved in the sight of God. The Tongue of Grandeur speaketh these blessed words: "Well is it with him who inquireth into their circumstances, and setteth right whatsoever is deficient." In truth, this matter is today of enormous moment. Please God, thou and the Afnán will continue your attentions as of yore. As for what thou didst write concerning the claims, accounts and debts of the wronged martyr, this was presented before the Divine Countenance. He said: "Trusting wholly in God, do thou proceed according to the commercial law. After the dues of the branches of the Divine Lote Tree and of the generality of mankind have been settled, it is essential to safeguard and protect the property of the heirs, insofar as this exceedeth not the bounds of wisdom, nor becometh a cause of sorrow and ill-feeling. The owner of the property hath passed out of this nether realm, and all that is therein, and returned unto a station such that the whole world would be powerless to depict the most inconsiderable of its praises. The welfare of the survivors likewise is in the hands of the One True God -- exalted be His estate. He, verily, is the best of advocates and the best of providers. Outwardly, however, there is the matter of reliance upon material means as provided by God, and all are commanded to adhere thereunto. Please God, thou mayest under all conditions be aided and assisted to serve the Cause of God." In truth thou hast borne extraordinary exertions in the path of God, and so likewise his honour Áqá Siyyid Ahmad the Afnán -- upon him be of all glories the Most Glorious. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto this station for which no peer or parallel could be conceived. It is the station of praise and thanksgiving. Under all conditions this evanescent servant beseecheth his Lord to send down upon thee from the heaven of His grace a mercy from His presence and a bounty from His side. He, verily, is the Great Giver, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.

Another Tablet was graciously revealed from the most pure Pen of the Blessed Beauty in honour of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs.

O 'Alí! Thy letter which thou didst send unto him who set himself towards My Kingdom, circled around My throne, and attained unto My presence, hath arrived before this Wronged One, and the servant in attendance hath presented it before the throne. Thy Lord, truly, heareth and seeth, and I am the All-Hearing. We have inhaled the fragrance of thy setting thyself, and turning thy face, towards Us, and have remembered thee as a bounty on Our part. His mercy hath surpassed the world. Thy Lord, truly, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Please God, with perfect joy and radiance, thou wilt speak forth with perfect wisdom the praise of Him Who is the Beloved of creation, and in all thy affairs fix thy gaze upon the horizon of His good pleasure. The root of the meaning of belief in the unity of God is this, that well-assured souls should under all circumstances direct their eyes exclusively towards the One True God, and move in accordance with His good pleasure. Were any soul in this day to perform every charitable work and goodly deed, yet attain not unto the good pleasure of the True One, assuredly this would bear no fruit. Thus it is that He saith, "Exert yourselves, that ye may attain unto the word indicative of His good pleasure." Do thou exert thyself so that all may attain unto this Most Sublime Station: that they may act for the sake of God; lay hold upon the permission of God; and cleave unto the good pleasure of God. O 'Alí! Do thou meditate upon the Light that shone forth from the Land of Sád. Till now most people have not acquired so much as a sprinkling from the ocean of his understanding. He had attained unto the true martyrdom. By My life! Years passed over him during which he was wholly selfless in the Will of his Lord, and in the Purpose of His Master. In no respect had he any thought, purpose, or will of his own; and at all times did he wait upon the Command of God. Without the leave and permission of the True One he embarked upon no enterprise. For years indeed he had already been a sacrifice in the path of the Beloved, although to outward seeming he spoke, heard, and walked like others. This is the Supreme Sacrifice, the Most Sublime Station, and the Most August Seat; and this exalted and most glorious station was crowned with outward martyrdom. He gleaned the pearls of the ocean of life, and cast them at the feet of the Beloved. Thus it was that he attained unto the Most Great Remembrance, while the Pen of the Most High was for a season occupied with his commemoration, so as to make manifest his work, his station, his rank and his devotion. O 'Alí! He attained unto a twofold martyrdom; and were the former station to be explained in detail, assuredly most people would be astounded. Please God, all the friends may attain unto that which is today beloved. We, verily, remember them in this Tablet, and rejoice them with tidings of the grace of God, and of His mercy that hath surpassed all created things. Say: Arise ye with the most great steadfastness in this Most Glorious and Exalted Cause, through the agency of which the Tongue of Grandeur hath proclaimed: "The Kingdom belongeth unto Him Who is the Possessor of all things visible and invisible!" All must quaff at every moment from the living waters of contentment, forasmuch as they are remembered in the Court of the True One, and their names writ down by the Pen of the Most High. Nor shall the stations of those souls that are well assured, contented, and pleasing unto God, remain hidden. If, pursuant to an inscrutable Divine wisdom, these should for a few days remain hidden, the Hand of Divine power shall assuredly tear away the veil, and make them manifest. Do thou likewise comfort the Children of Moses with the remembrance of this Wronged One. Blessed and happy are they for having turned unto the Divine Countenance, and directed themselves towards the ocean of knowledge in a day whereon all things trembled for fear of God, the All-Glorious, the Most Exalted. Please God, all may be on the Straight Path; may fix their eyes upon His horizon; and may perform that whereunto they have been commanded. We, verily, send at this moment Our salutation unto thee, and unto My servants and My handmaidens from this Glorious and Incomparable Spot.

Concerning the Twin Shining Lights, the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- says in the Tablet of the martyred Varqá.

*His exalted Utterance:*

Wealth prevented them not from drawing nigh unto God, and worldly splendour withheld them not from laying down alike their substance and their life. Heavenly Hasan offered up his life as a sacrifice on this nether plane; while Husayn of the domain of mystic meanings lost his life in the most explicit outward sense. What liquor had the one imbibed, and what nectar had the other quaffed? Gracious God! The minds of men are bewildered and astonished. How well did that nomadic desert-dweller say:

Ne'er a hair of my felt raiment * I'd give, were the world my payment.

By "felt raiment" he intended an expression of his love and devotion. Gracious God! Although the afore-mentioned souls were possessed of outward wealth and standing, and of honour and exaltation amidst mankind, yet were the things they possessed incapable of debarring them from the things that are with God.

In the Lawh-i-Kitábu's-Sidq (Tablet of the Book of Truth), He says.

*His exalted Utterance:*

The incident of the Land of Sád was the occasion for heart-consuming grief, and for wailing and lamentation among God's servants. Yet, should a person of discernment think deeply upon the matter, and consider it in a state of absolute detachment from the world of being, he would perceive that there hath never been, nor is there now, any more glorious a matter than that which hath befallen: in so asserting, this servant speaketh as one who is acquainted in detail with the circumstances of the Twin Shining Lights from the beginning even until now. Briefly, they attained in 'Iráq unto the Most Holy Court, where the utmost loving-kindness was shown them. This matter fell out at first contrary to the imaginations of some; howbeit the Hand of Divine power raised them up; arrayed them with the robe of honour; and from the heaven of bounty rained down blessings upon them, until at last they attained the station that thou hast seen, and whereof thou hast heard. After their return from the Most Holy Court unto the Land of Sád, they despatched hither two letters wherein, with utmost lowliness and ardour, they besought of Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High, the very thing which actually befell. Consider now: praise be to God, so long as they lived, they were seen to occupy, through the loving-kindness of the One True God, a position of the utmost honour among His servants, love for them indeed having been instilled into people's hearts to a degree that none save God, the True One, hath ever been, or is now, able to reckon; while at the end of their days they attained unto that Supreme Sacrifice which they themselves had sought. Thereafter too thou hast witnessed what was sent down concerning them from the Pen of the Most High. I swear by God! By reason of that which hath been revealed for them all things lament; the Rock (Peter) crieth out; and the inmates of Paradise weep sore. Should anyone possess the whole earth, and bestow it all, never would he attain unto such a station. This is a station for which all the Divine Messengers, and those who have drawn nigh unto God, have ever hoped, and do so still. Till now, well nigh a hundred Tablets have been revealed touching this supreme calamity; nay more, inasmuch as it is observed that in these days too mention is made of the martyrs in some of the Tablets.

In My Name, the Exile, the Sorrowful

Alas, alas, O thou King of Fidelity! And again alas, alas, O thou Prince of Equity in the realm of creation! Do we see thee a prisoner in the hands of the most wretched among God's creatures; or do we see thee a martyr in the path of God, the Lord of all mankind? I swear by Thy glory, O thou My Name Há'! Grievous is it to the people of Bahá' to hear what hath befallen thee in the love of God, the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below! Grievous is it to the Most Great Name to behold the world, yet to behold thee not; to hear the tumult of the nations, yet to hear neither thy cry nor the voice of thy communion! God is My witness! All things bewail thy tribulation, while the Pen of the Most High weepeth betwixt the fingers of Him Who is the Lord of all Names. We testify that whoever arose to inflict harm upon thee is of those who, throughout all ages, have disbelieved in God, the Lord of this world and of the next. Thou art he through whom the preamble of the Book of Fidelity hath been illuminated in the kingdom of creation, and the Temple of Servitude hath been decked forth among them who are the manifestations of names. Fie upon a people who wronged thee, when through thee the Balance of Justice had been set in the days of thy Lord, the All-Glorious. Thus have We made mention of thee aforetime, and at this moment, with My Most Exalted Pen.

He is the Wronged One

Alas, alas, O God of Mercy! Thou wast wont at all times to comfort those of Thy servants who had been touched by tribulations in Thy days; yet who today will comfort Thee in this trial before which all trials have bowed down, and in this sorrow through which all sorrows have been dumbfounded? I was wont to see Thee, O Thou Wronged One of the World, console Thy chosen ones in adversity and affliction; yet who today will console Thee in this grief through which the face of the earth hath been changed, and all hearts have been consumed? Alas, I cry, with an anguish exceeding that of every ardent sigh, and a fervour whereby the world hath trembled and the hearts of the nations have been consumed, inasmuch as I see Thee plunged into such sorrow that thou delightest not even to hear the name Ridván, how much less to contemplate Thy favours and bounties which have been so plentifully vouchsafed therein. O my Lord, the fire of oppression blazeth throughout the world: where is the light of Thy justice, O Thou Who art the Everlasting King? I swear by Thy might, O Thou Wronged, Imprisoned One! Grievous is it to me to see the Temple of Justice in the clutches of oppression; and grievous is it to me to see the Dawning-place of Fidelity in the hands of the wicked doers. I know not, O my Lord, and the Lord of earth and heaven, whether he hath quaffed from the fount of martyrdom, or bideth still at the mercy of them through whom the ensigns of tyranny were planted amidst mankind. I swear by Thy sovereignty, O Thou the Beloved of creation, and the Desire of all things visible and invisible! Were the eyes of the whole world to weep, and the hearts of all nations to be consumed, it would still be unworthy of this affliction, wherein all things hear the clamour of Thine heart and the lamentation of Thy soul. I bear witness that this is a tribulation such as no pen can describe nor any tongue recount. The matter is in the hand of God, the Lord of creation.

He is the Faithful Announcer

O Land of Sád! Where is he who loved God and His chosen ones, and where is he who was under all conditions occupied in His service? Where is he who shone forth above the horizon of fidelity like unto the sun rising above the earth's horizon? Where is he whom I had entrusted unto thee? Hast thou delivered him into the hands of his enemies, or hath he laid down his life in the path of God, the Lord of all names? Tell Me, what have the people done with him through whom the Cause of God was made manifest among His servants, and the horizon of amity illumined in every land? Tell Me truly, where is the Most Great Trust? And where is he that circled around God, the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below? Where is that spirit who became embodied in human form that he might render service unto God, the Supreme Ordainer? O Land of Sád! Where is the spreading tree of love, its boughs and branches, its leaves and fruits? In answer she crieth out, saying: "I swear by Thy Beauty, O Thou Who art the King of Glory, and the Beloved of Há'! Powerless am I to recount what I have seen perpetrated by the enemies. By Thy might! I shame to tell what the people have done with him who was their lord, their master, their succourer, and their helper. How can I speak of that whereby Thine heart will be saddened, O Thou Who art the Desire of earth and heaven? Every time I purpose to speak, I am prevented by my weeping. Thou indeed art He Who knoweth man's secret thought and private conversation. By Thy might, O Thou Who art my King! Wert Thou to decree mine extinction, more welcome would it be to me than to make mention, and to discourse, before Thee of that which would occasion sorrows during the days which Thou hast appointed as the dawning-places of happiness unto Thy loved ones, and the daysprings of joy unto the dwellers of Thy realm. This I say, confident as I am in the ocean of Thy knowledge, the heaven of Thy Purpose, the pervasive influence of Thy Will, and the all-encompassing scope of Thy might. Would that I had never existed, rather than that I should have seen Thee sorrowful, O Thou Lord of the nations, and King of everlasting days!" O Clime of Sád! Alack, how is it that I see thy herds of camels, and hear their braying, yet see not My she-camel, neither hear her plaintive call? Is she in the meadows above the earth, or doth she lie beneath them? O gardens of that city! Where is the breeze of God that bloweth over thee? And where is the Fruit of God within thee? Hath it been plucked, or hath it fallen? I swear by God! The people, truly, are in grievous error. They have hamstrung the She-Camel, although she had supplied them with purest milk from the breast of the wisdom of God, the Lord of all worlds. O My Name Há'! We, verily, concealed thy station whilst thou wast on earth, by reason of the frailty of Our servants: then, when thou wast ascended, We revealed thee, and made manifest all that thou art, and that which God, the Almighty, the All-Praised, had bestowed upon thee. Blessed is he who loveth thee; who delighteth in communion with thee; who hearkeneth unto thy call, thy remembrance, and thy praise; who directeth his steps towards thy resting-place; and who turneth his face unto thy face in the path of God, thy Beloved, thine Aim, and thy Revealer. Blessed is every visitor who visiteth thy most exalted shrine and thy most glorious seat; who standeth before thy grave, and who addresseth thee in the words that were revealed by the Pen of the Most High, and which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered in the prison-city of 'Akká. Happy is he that remembereth thy days, and all that appeared from thee in the love of God, thy Lord; and who relateth unto the people that which befell thee in the service of the Cause of thy Lord. By God! He, verily, is numbered with the people of Bahá' in a noble Tablet. O My Name Há'! Thou art he who was in his own homeland a stranger, in his dwelling-place a prisoner, and among God's servants oppressed and forsaken. Blessed is the land that God hath made the repository of thy mortal form, and the city above whose horizon thou didst shine forth during the days of thy Lord. It behoveth every lover to make mention of thee in the same words wherewith God hath made mention of thee in His Tablets. And we beseech Him through thee to send down upon His loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Him; He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Gracious.

He is the Comforter, the Consoler, the Exalted, the Most Glorious

Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the King of names, for that Thou hast converted joy into vexation, and pitched the tent of sorrows during Thy festival of Ridván. I swear by Thy glory! I repine not at that which hath befallen Me in Thy path. By Thy name, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names! Tribulation borne for love of Thee is, verily, My cherished wish, the goal of My desire, and the solace of Mine heart; yet do I long to announce unto the world that from the Lote Tree of Fidelity the Most Exalted Fruit hath fallen, inasmuch as it was compassed by tempestuous winds blowing from the right hand of Thy decree, and smitten by the assault of Thine appointment as inscribed by the Pen of Thy behest. O My Lord! The sea of troubles hath surged during the days of Thy happiness, and the fragrance of sorrows hath wafted even in the day of Thy blissful joy. Hath the refulgent orb of Thy Name Há' set beneath the horizon of Sád, or is he still in the clutches of the enemies, who have cast away Thy Testament, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all names? O Land of Sád! Doth My Name yet walk upon thy surface, or hath there reposed within thy womb a trust from Me? O insensate land! How canst thou be still, when the very ocean is concealed within thee? And how canst thou be illumined, when the refulgent orb hath set beneath thy horizon? O Land of Sád! Where is thy lamp, and where thy straight path? Where is God's overflowing fount within thee, and where the Lote Tree whose shade God had made a shelter unto all that resorted thither, or sought it out, or chanced upon it in their travels? I swear by God! O My Name Há'! By reason of thine agony the Pen of the Most High hath halted; the dwellers of the Cities of the Names of God have lamented; and the hearts of His chosen ones have melted. Thou art he who accepted not a ransom in the love of God, the Lord of this world and of the next; and repeatedly craved of God that which actually befell him. Thou art the Most Great Ransom in the Crimson Book. Did the people think that they had gained by their transaction? Nay, by Him Who is the King of Names! God is My witness that they suffered a loss such as hath had no equal in the knowledge of God, the Lord of the throne above and of earth below. The Tongue of Grandeur testifieth that it is thou who hast gained by this transaction. Nay by My life! All gain is thine, inasmuch as thou hast quit the earth, whose every atom beareth witness unto its evanescence; hast set thy face towards the dawning-place of eternity; and hast yielded thy life in thy yearning for the love of God, the Creator of the heavens and the Lord of all names. By thy life, O My Name! By reason of thine agony the afflictions of the saints have been effaced, and the eyes of God's chosen ones and the Celestial Concourse have run down with tears. It hath reached such a pass that He Who is the Manifestation of God's Ancient Beauty among the nations hath been sorrowed. Wert thou present before this Wronged One in thine outward temple, and didst behold in what condition the Pen of the Most High recounteth thine afflictions, thou wouldst wail even as a bereaved mother in the kingdom of creation. Alas, alas, O My Name Há'! And again alas, alas, O My Name that shineth above the horizon of fidelity! And yet again, alas I cry, with a fervour such as to cause oceans to well forth from the eyes, and the hearts and souls to melt. Thou art he through whom the tale of the Sacrifice (Ishmael) hath been retold, and that which had been hidden in the knowledge of God, and written in His Mighty Book, hath come to pass. O Land of Sád! Speak true, I prithee, and tell Me, Where is the She-Camel of God, that trod thy byways and grazed in thy fair pastures? Doth she still graze today, or hath she been hamstrung by the enemies of God, and by the enemies of His chosen ones and His servants? Then tell Me, did she drink and ascend, or did she suffer martyrdom whilst parched, and so ascend unto the Abhá Horizon and the realms above? Then tell Me, left she anyone behind to guard her home; to gather together her kin; to calm their trepidation; to fortify their hearts; to comfort them in their distress; and to console them in their grief and sorrow? Thou must needs in such a case, and at this very moment, repeat: The Kingdom is God's the Lord of the worlds! Verily, we are God's, and unto Him shall we indeed return.

He is the Rememberer, the All-Knowing

Glory be unto Thee, O Lord My God! Thou seest and knowest what hath befallen Thy chosen ones during the days of Thy Revelation, and dost behold and witness the things they have borne for love of Thee and for the sake of Thy pleasure. O My Lord! The chronicles of the world attest the abasement of Thy loved ones and the glory of Thine enemies, while the books of all peoples bear witness unto the powerlessness of Thy chosen ones and the might of those who disbelieved in Thy signs. Thou hearest, O My God, at this moment, the sighs, the prayers, the invocations, and the intercessions I utter on behalf of such of Thy creatures as are nigh unto Thee, and such of Thy people as have recognized Thy oneness. Thy glory beareth Me witness, O Thou Who art the Sovereign of the realm above, and the Ruler of the kingdom! I know of a surety that abasement in Thy path is an honour with which no worldly honour can compare, and that even fire in Thy love is a light such as the veils of all peoples cannot obscure. Were I to quaff, O My God, at every moment the cup of tribulation from the hands of Mine enemies, never would the thirst of My yearning and the drought of My longing be quenched. He that hath once quaffed the pure beverage of Thy love, and been inebriated by the wine of Thy knowledge, shall never be downcast by aught that is in Thine earth, nor distracted by any matter from fixing his eyes upon the horizon of Thy Revelation, and upon Thy most effulgent Beauty and Thy most sublime and lofty station. My Most Exalted Pen, verily, longeth that its own shrill voice, its piteous cry and plaintive clamour should at all times be raised in this affliction, which hath caused the denizens of Paradise and the dwellers of the All-Highest Heaven to lament. It hath come to such a pass that the Tongue of Him Who is the Revealer of Thy Cause, the Ocean of Thy knowledge, and the Dayspring of Thine inspiration is occupied with mourning, in token of His grace, His mercy, and His fidelity. O My Name Há'! Thou, verily, art in the Most Exalted Paradise, and thine head hath been adorned with the crown of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Possessor of all names; while those that love thee are in such a state of despondency that the clouds weep for them in the daytime and in the night season. Dost thou now reveal the true aspect of thy station, or dost thou yet conceal it, even as thy Lord was wont to conceal it as a precaution on His part? Thy Lord, truly, is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. Thou art he through whom the Most Great Sacrifice hath been made manifest, and its reality established among the nations. O My Name Há'! I swear by God that through thee the horizon of fidelity hath been illumined, and that which hath resulted in the diffusion of the Cause of God, the Creator of the heavens, hath been revealed. Blessed is the eye that weepeth for thy sufferings; the ear that hearkeneth unto thy praise; the face that turneth towards thee; and the soul that hasteneth to attain thy resting-place, the spot that hath been honoured to receive thy noble earthly frame and thy sanctified and precious temple. By God! The hearts have been consumed by reason of the calamity that befell thee, and the vitals lacerated by reason of thy tragic fate. O Land of Sád! I adjure thee by the Well-Beloved, to tell Me, hath the fragrance of the lover, through whom the perfume of the Divine raiment was wafted among the people of sanctity, ceased to pervade thee? And is he fallen into the clutches of every oppressor that hath disbelieved in God and His Verses, and hath turned away from His Countenance and His sovereignty? O gentle gale! Hast thou come from the quarter of the lover unto the Well-Beloved with tidings such as to rejoice the souls, or with an annunciation fit to sear the hearts? O thou breath of My native land! By My life! I inhale not from thee the fragrance of him that loved Me. 'Tis like he hath winged his flight from this earth's bough unto the realms above and the Abhá Horizon. O My Name! Blessed the eye that weepeth over thy sufferings, whereat My Name Há' in the Land of Taff (Karbilá) crieth aloud and saith: "O thou Name Há'! By thy life! Through thy suffering mine own sufferings, my sorrows, mine anguish and mine affliction have been renewed." O Earth of the City! Relate thou what betided him and his brother when they attended the gathering of the oppressors, who had at no time inhaled the sweet savour of equity, and who chose rather the part of arbitrariness. By God! Through them the Word of God which proceeded out of the mouth of the Primal Will was established upon the throne of revelation. He said, and truly did He speak: "Verily, I and all who are in Paradise in pursuance of the Most Great Justice do yearn to meet a soul that hath been slain in His path." Thus spake He in truth, and that which had been concealed in the knowledge of God was made manifest. My Tongue testifieth in the Kingdom of Mine Utterance that the twain were martyred in My path, and that My heart and My pen, and those that have circled around My throne, soared in the heaven of My nearness, and quaffed the choice wine of My favours from the hands of My loving-kindness, have bewailed them. O My Name, and My loved ones! Although the calamity that befell you is such that the Concourse on High and the inmates of the all-glorious Tabernacle have wailed and lamented, yet doth this Wronged One give praise unto God, and yield Him thanks, inasmuch as He graciously assisted you to recognize the Dawning-place of His Cause, and so elevated your stations that His Most Exalted Pen mourneth over you in this most sublime station. Blessed is the soul that turneth towards you; the heart that attaineth unto your love; the visitor that visiteth your resting-place; and the seeker that entereth into your land, cleaveth unto your cord, and payeth homage to your shrine. By the righteousness of God! These, truly, are of the blissful; and these, truly, are numbered among His favoured servants in the Book of God, the King, the Inaccessible, the Most Great. Praise be to God, the Lord of all that was and shall be. Verily, we are God's, and unto Him shall we return.

In My Name, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful

O Land of Sád! Where is the Most Great Sacrifice, he that accepted not a ransom in the path of God, the Lord of all mankind? And where are they that were martyred by reason of their love for this Youth, Who no sooner did He appear than the backs of the idols that had pronounced judgment against the Bearers of the Trust of God, the Lord of the worlds, were broken? O branch of My Lote Tree! Where is My dove that would ever pour forth its songs, its joyful warblings and gentle cooings? Hath it winged its flight unto the realms above, or have the wrong-doers seized it with the talons of hatred betwixt earth and heaven? I prithee inform Me, and be not of the reticent! Where are the brilliant stars, the shining orbs, the signal months, the lustrous days, and the effulgent lights? By God, they have set, disappeared, been veiled from sight, and returned whence they had come; yet are the people in patent discord. O My Ridván! How is it that I see thy birds, and hear their songs, yet see not My dove, neither hear its melodies? Remaineth it yet in this vain life, or hath it winged its flight unto the Eternal Garden? Recount to Me its tale, nor be of them that hold their peace! "O great and omnipotent Master! Long have Thy sorrows lasted, wherefore the hearts of Thy chosen ones are bewildered, and the dwellers in Thy Tabernacle have bewailed Thee. I swear by Thy glory! Thy call and Thy commemoration have not ceased. I hear each dawn Thy sighs; each day Thy groaning; and each night Thy plaints and piteous cries. Have pity on Thy servants and Thy loved ones! I bear witness, O Thou My Best-Beloved, that to suffer martyrdom in Thy path hath ever been the hope of Thy Prophets and the Bearers of Thy Trust." So indeed affirmed the Point of the Bayán, Who suffered martyrdom in Thy path; He said, and truly did He speak: "O Thou Remnant of God! I have sacrificed Myself wholly for Thee; I have accepted curses for Thy sake, and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in the path of Thy love." Whoso attaineth unto this most sublime station hath attained unto all good both in this world and in the next. Thou art He Who testifieth in truth, and Thou, verily, art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

O Thou Lord of Utterance!

Peace, hold thy tongue! Thou hast o'erstepped thy bound! Return thou unto God, and be of the penitent. Wouldst thou question any act of Him Who it behoveth not should be asked of His doings? Take thou refuge with God, Who created thee and fashioned thee, and be not of the heedless. Thou hast not attained so much as the shore of one of the oceans of the wisdom of thy Lord, how much less their boundless floods and fathomless deeps, and whatsoever hath been hidden in His knowledge, which transcendeth all worlds. He it is through Whom the ensign of "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" hath been planted, and the standard of "He shall not be asked of that which He hath wrought" hath been hoisted upon every lofty peak. O Wayfarer of the Spirit! Renounce this theme, and all that is uttered in the kingdom of creation; then set thyself to attain the far-off goal and the most august seat, the station which hath been adorned with the lights of the supernal realm, and been honoured by the glances of the loving-kindness of God, the Sovereign of the kingdoms of earth and heaven. We, verily, have purposed that thou shouldst be the first wayfarer and the first visitor to convey on the part of Him Who is the Dawning-place of Sanctity the sweet fragrance of the Divine raiment unto a land wherein have appeared the Supreme Sacrifice and they who were the Most Great Ransoms. We counsel thee to be on thy guard, for the Wolf howleth and the She-Serpent hisseth.

*When thou hast drawn nigh unto the city, and perceived its traces, halt thou and say:*

O City of the Lover! Where is the ocean of the love of God, and where the ships that sailed upon it? Where are thy flowing springs, and where thy brilliant stars, breaking forth above the horizon? Where are thy lofty and refulgent diadems, and where thy shining and resplendent moons? Prithee tell what have the oppressors done with them: is it such as may flow forth from the pen, or such as all pens would be powerless to recount? The matter is in the hand of God, the Lord of all men. O City of the Lover! By the righteousness of God! That which they bore at the hands of the oppressors shall not have been in vain. Unto this beareth witness He Who hath knowledge of all things, whether secret or open, and Who mourneth His loved ones and His chosen ones in token of His grace, His fidelity, His loving-kindness and His favours. By Him Who is the Truth! They, verily, have secured a mighty gain, although the people are in evident doubt.

*Set then thyself towards the Holy Martyrs' Tombs and the Exalted Shrines,* *and, when thou hast known, hast found, and come before them, stand and say:*

The first light that shone forth from the horizon of the revelation of the Face of your Lord, the Creator of the Heavens, be upon you, O ye the manifestations of fidelity, and the dawning-places of names in the kingdom of creation! I testify that through you the standards of victory have been manifested, the ensigns of guidance have been hoisted, the horizon of steadfastness hath been illumined, and the breeze of God hath been wafted amidst mankind; and through you the glory of sacrifice hath been renewed, and that which hath caused the hearts and minds to marvel hath appeared. It is ye who sacrificed all that ye possessed, your spirits, your every limb and vein, in the path of God, your Well-Beloved and your hearts' Desire. It is ye whom neither the wrong of the oppressor, nor the blame of the blamer, nor the onslaught of every disbeliever who turned away from God when he came invested with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all who are in heaven and on earth, could deter from following in His way. I testify that the Celestial Concourse, and with them the dwellers of the All-Glorious Tabernacle, have bewailed your agony; while on behalf of every believer the Tongue of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, hath spoken: "Verily, we are God's, and unto Him shall we return." In all conditions, praise be to God, the Lord of all that was and shall be.

*Then beseech of God whatsoever thou desirest of His bounty; He, verily, is the All-Glorious, the All-Loving.*

He is the Most Holy, the Most Great

O thou companion! I swear by God! The tale of the Sacrifice (Ishmael), and that which was hidden in the knowledge of God, the Lord of the worlds, hath been repeated. The bird of fidelity hath winged its flight from this earth's bough unto the Sadratu'l-Muntahá, by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. We testify that he is now wrapt in an ecstasy of joy such as no mortal joy can rival, while his lovers are so immersed in sorrow that all things weep for them. Thy Lord, truly, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing. God is My witness! It was they, verily, who gained by this transaction, and the wrong-doers who lost. These, of a surety, are in grievous loss. Was it Husayn who lost by laying down his life in the path of God, or was it those that wronged him, through having followed every impious miscreant, far gone in error? Oppression hath reached such a pitch that the tongue, and beyond it every knowledgeable assayer, are powerless to describe it. They have lit a fire whose blaze shall not be extinguished in the world. Thus informeth thee He with Whom is the knowledge of all things, as recorded in a Lucid Book. O Khalíl! Observe thou to what degree the rightness of the truth and the waywardness of falsehood have become clear and evident! All bear witness that the utmost affection, mercy and loving-kindness were shown by that wronged one towards all peoples, while no untoward action, such as might become a cause of mischief or an occasion of disorder, ever emanated from him. How many the poor of foreign nations whom he succoured during the days of hardship. Unto this testify all who speak truly, and beyond them thy Lord, the All-Informed. Should anyone reflect upon him, and the marks of loving-kindness shown him by his Lord, he would see with the eye of certitude that in what hath befallen there was, and is, a surpassing wisdom. The Supreme Ransom and the Most Great Sacrifice have been made manifest in this Mighty Cause. In 'Iráq, when he entered the Most Holy Court, the utmost loving-kindness was shown him by the Source of Command, to the degree that certain souls spoke in a manner that revealed them to be wandering in the wilds of fancy. Thereafter, with consummate power, the One True God raised up that lote tree to a station whereof none but Him, the All-Knowing, is apprised; and sent down for him a blessing from His presence and a mercy from His side. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Powerful. Divers letters arrived from him before the throne, wherein he besought his Lord, the Possessor of this world and of the next, to ordain that he might attain unto the Supreme Sacrifice. By thy life, O Khalíl! By reason of that which befell him, all other calamities have been effaced. Unto this testifieth thy Lord, the Wronged One, the Exile. We have sent down from the heaven of grace that wherewith the kingdoms of earth and heaven can never be compared: erelong shall God cause that which hath been planted in the land of utterance to germinate; He, verily, is the All-Powerful, Whom the hosts of the world and the cohorts of the oppressors are powerless to frustrate. O Khalíl! From time immemorial even until now, the Divine Lote Tree, which the hand of God's sovereign purpose hath planted in the good and blessed land, hath been watered by the blood of them that are wholly devoted to His Cause, and truly recognize His unity. Soon, through the acts of the oppressors, shall it stand revealed and manifest in the land. Hath the oppressor imagined that God is heedless of that which he hath wrought? Nay, by Him Who is potent over all things! I swear by the Sovereign Truth! God shall make outwardly manifest in the land whatsoever He hath sent down in the Book: unto this testify all who discern the truth in things, through the guidance of God, the Lord of the worlds. Consider the Súriy-i-Ra'ís and other Tablets. By the righteousness of God! Thine heart, and the hearts of all who are endued with understanding, shall be rejoiced by that which hath been revealed therein. Verily, should He wish it, He could lay hold on all the peoples of the earth through a word from Him; howbeit He revealeth His Cause pursuant to a wisdom that lieth hidden in his all-embracing knowledge. I swear by the Sun of Might! Had the world been possessed of any value, never would the Ancient Beauty have consented to tarry for so many years in the Most Great Prison. So long as man abideth on earth, he remaineth, now as formerly, in a state of stupefaction; excepting only those whose hearts are empty of attachment, and who look into things with the eye of God. Please God, thou wilt, so far as thou art able, impart tranquillity and assurance unto illumined hearts, that they may be filled with tranquillity after perturbation, and with gladness after sorrow. Thus commandeth thee He Who remembereth thee in this glorious station. O Khalíl! A mighty happening hath come to pass in the world. Though yet greater hath previously occurred, even as thou thyself dost witness and attest, yet, since a considerable period had elapsed during which the Hand of Divine Power had been exercising its protective sway -- when of a sudden this inexorable Divine judgment befell -- for this reason did it become a cause of wailing, of weeping and of great commotion. Yet hath thy Lord in store that whereby the hearts shall be rejoiced after this mighty sorrow. Say: This is a sacrifice whose effects have penetrated the world. Erelong shall God make them manifest through the power of truth; potent is He to do whatsoever He willeth. The Glory of God rest upon thee, and upon all them that have hearkened unto thy word in the Cause of God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning.

He is the One that Speaketh before the Divine Countenance

O ye dwellers of the cities and villages! Hearken ye unto that which the Tongue proclaimeth in the kingdom of utterance on the part of Him Who hath caused all things to proclaim: "There is none other God but Me, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing!" He it is Who hath sent down the Books, and sent forth the Messengers, announcing through them: "There is none other God but Me, the Ever-Watchful, the All-Wise!" All things have been privileged to hearken unto the Call, save every unconscionable transgressor; and every eye hath beheld God's All-Glorious Horizon, save every heedless one that is far astray. By God! The Most Sublime Vision hath been made manifest, and He Who is the Supreme Ordainer calleth aloud and saith: "Members of the human race! The Great Day hath come; the Moon hath been cleft in twain; and all are caught up in a wondrous resurrection. That which had lain hidden hath been revealed; that which had been stored away hath been brought forth; and the Promised One hath come down from the heaven of God's decree swifter than the twinkling of an eye. Yet are the people under a plain delusion. They see the sun, yet say, 'Is it indeed a sun?;' and they behold the Verses, yet say, 'Naught are they but a mighty sorcery!' Even so hath it been decreed in the Book; yet are the people that are wrapped in veils assailed by strange misgivings!" O ye beloved of the All-Merciful throughout the world! This Wronged One, verily, adjureth you by the Beloved of creation, Who speaketh forth in the kingdom of utterance, that ye deal not faithlessly with the property of others. Be ye the trustees of God in His cities, and the daysprings of truthfulness in His lands. Blessed is he that hearkeneth unto the counsel of God, and is of those who put it into effect. Such instances of faithlessness have been encountered in this exile that Mine heart hath melted, Mine eye hath wept, My soul hath lamented, and My breast hath been sore straitened. By the righteousness of God! Sleep hath fled from the eyes of Bahá' by reason of that which hath befallen Him in this snow-white Spot. To this all things testify; yet are the people sunk in heedlessness. The Rock (Peter) hath cried out by reason of the trials I have suffered, and the Divine Lote Tree hath lamented on account of the hardships I have endured. God is My witness! I sorrow not for Myself, but for the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. All sorrows are His Who is precluded from making mention of the trials and hardships that have touched Him in this noble habitation! We hearken unto falsehood and observe silence, and the speaker conceiveth that he hath imposed upon Us, and that We have found his words to be conspicuously true. O My loved ones! Array yourselves in the Divine virtues, and adorn your temples with the robes of trustworthiness, of steadfastness and of truthfulness; thus hath the Lord of creation commanded you in the Guarded Tablet. Our sorrows have lately been compounded, inasmuch as We behold the temple of love, and those that are with him, caught in the clutches of malice at the hands of the hosts of their oppressors. Say ye: "O Thou Who art the Lord of all Names, and the Creator of the heavens! We ask Thee by this martyr, who hath yielded his life in these days so that he may proclaim Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word, to send down upon Thy loved ones and Thy chosen ones that which shall preserve them from the clutches of heedlessness and doubt. Give them, then, to drink, from the hands of Thy bounteousness, the living waters of certitude. Thou, verily, art the Bestower, the Beneficent. No God is there but Thee, the Gracious, the Giver, the Generous."

He is the Rememberer, the Sorrowful

O Land of Sád! Relate thou what the people have done with the family of the Prophet, and what hath befallen the children of the Virgin at the hands of thy dwellers. O Land of Sád! The Sun of the Hijáz inquireth of thee after His family, and the spotless Virgin after her sons and her daughter. Have the oppressors entombed them in a darksome well, or have they drawn them forth with the cords of malice in order to subject them to a fresh affliction? By the life of the Beloved! The powers of heaven have been shaken by this dire calamity. Alas, alas! The Luminary of Bathá (Mecca) hath lamented amongst the Celestial Concourse by reason of that which hath befallen His family at the hands of them who are the embodiments of malice. O dwellers of Sád! Ye have committed that whereat those who are the very dawning-places of presumption and the daysprings of rebellion in this world are astounded. Judge ye fairly: By what proof did ye slay them through whom the Cause of the All-Merciful hath been diffused throughout the East and the West? Alas, alas! Through you the Ark of the Prophet hath been broken, and the offspring of the Virgin have been drowned; and through you happiness hath been converted into sorrows, and darkness hath overtaken all peoples, save only those whom the All-Merciful hath pleased to spare. O dwellers of Sád! Hearken ye unto the words wherewith Muhammad, the Apostle of God, calleth you from the Supreme Horizon: "O ye perverse and wicked generation! Where is My Hasan, who was ablaze with the fire of the love of God in the kingdom of creation, and adorned with the ornament of fidelity betwixt earth and heaven? And where is My Husayn, who accepted not a ransom in the path of God, the Lord of all mankind? By My life! O ye company of evil-doers! No room hath been left you to excuse or justify yourselves, in virtue of My words: 'The pious are God's and the impious are Mine.' Do ye conceive yourselves believers, and do ye account yourselves among the people of the Furqán? Nay, by Him Who is the All-Merciful! Whosoever among the learned is clothed in the raiment of virtue hath deplored your deed; and whosoever among the wise is adorned with the ornament of justice hath exclaimed in protest at your actions. The voice of the lamentation of the Celestial Concourse hath been raised on account of your oppression, and all things have cried out by reason of that which your hands have wrought. Ye read the Qur'án, yet repudiate its Root, and Him that sent it down; and ye acknowledge My prophetic mission, yet slay My children, and turn away from Him that sent Me forth. I am bewildered at you, O ye concourse of the hateful! Yea, all that hath been created by the Word of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, is similarly perplexed." O Wayfarer of the deep! Where are Thy ships? Have they broken upon the rocks of disbelief and discord, or have they foundered under the battering winds of oppression and malice? Have they journeyed from the cities of the bodies unto the gardens of the souls, or have they migrated from the wilderness of separation and remoteness unto the station of nearness, sanctity and reunion? "O Prince of the world! Thy might and Thy sovereignty bear Me witness! Powerless am I to relate how the winds of oppression have assailed them. I swear by Thine own Self! It shameth Me to disclose that which I have seen and known. Thou indeed knowest best what is in Me, yet know I not what is in Thee. Thou, truly, art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Howbeit this word shall I speak in token of My submission unto Thine irresistible command, and Mine observance of Thine incontrovertible decree: The nightingale hath taken flight, inasmuch as the croaking of the raven hath been raised. The command belongeth to God, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing."

I am the Wronged One, the Exile

O Samandar! By thy life! The affliction of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, hath been renewed in the All-highest Paradise, and thereto the anguish of the spotless Virgin in the Most Exalted Station. "Fie upon you, O people of the Furqán!" she exclaimeth, "Ye have wrought even that which ye wrought aforetime! Where is my Hasan, and where my Husayn? Announce their fate, nor be of them that turn away! Did my Hasan deal faithlessly amongst you, unlawfully devour your wealth, or shed your blood? Judge ye fairly, O people, and be not of them that speak falsely! Explain ye, O people of the Furqán! For what crime did ye slay my Husayn in the Land of Sád?" By My life, O thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon My Countenance! The Ark hath been shattered, and the She-Camel hath been hamstrung by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. The Tale of Taff (Karbilá) hath been retold; yet are the people wrapped in a palpable veil. We, verily, concealed the station of My Name Hasan by reason of the frailty of Our servants; then, when he was ascended on the wings of the spirit unto the realms above, We disclosed a part of that which God had bestowed upon him, in token of His grace: He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Know further: That which hath come to pass shall exert an influence in the world: erelong shall this become apparent through the sovereignty of God, the Almighty, the Most Powerful. Oppression hath reached the pitch that alike the pen and the tongue are powerless and inadequate to recount or express it. Souls who at no time harmed another soul; who comported themselves with perfect love and kindliness; and who lived on terms of friendliness with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth -- behold what was inflicted upon them! Were it to be inquired of those two embodiments of ignorance who regard themselves as learned, "Wherefore slew ye these wronged ones, notwithstanding that no crime or sin had been committed on their part?," they would, in reply, undoubtedly repeat the same words uttered by the mouths of the infidels in respect of the Prince of Martyrs -- may all else but him be His sacrifice. After the business of the Land of Káf, the company of the oppressors were wont to repeat this utterance:

"Husayn beyond his limit stray'd, * so slain was, by his grandsire's blade."

Fie upon them, and upon those that have followed in their footsteps! This apart, what blame attached unto the Prophet's children who were in that household? This business shall never be obliterated from the tablet of creation. For all four souls there hath been sent down from the heaven of God's loving-kindness that which hath changed the world's happiness into grief. Although to outward seeming the people of oppression are complacent about the deed they have committed, yet, by My life, their realities curse them, and lament over them, albeit they neither hear, nor feel, nor know it. Do thou convey Our salutation unto all the friends. Please God, all may, with the utmost joy and radiance, be occupied with the remembrance of God, and lay hold upon, and cleave tenaciously unto, the strong cord of patience and fortitude. Cast thou, on My behalf, a salutation over thy brother's countenance. We ask Him, exalted be He, graciously to confirm him, and to ordain for him that which shall profit him. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We seal Our utterance with the mention of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting: "Verily, we are God's, and unto Him shall we return."

In My Name, the One Sanctified above the World of Being

The Book of Generosity, sent down by the King of everlasting days! Whoever adorneth himself therewith is of those that are celebrated amongst men, and whom the All-Merciful blesseth from His inaccessible and glorious realm. Yet for all the excellence of its worth and the grandeur of its station, if it exceed its due bounds it is designated "extravagance" by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Choose ye the part of moderation: this is that whereunto the All-Possessing, the Most High, hath commanded you in a noble Book. Spend ye, O ye who are the manifestations of this Name and the dawning-places of this Attribute, upon them whom ye find to be in conspicuous poverty. Say: Beware, O possessors of riches, lest the term "conspicuous" hold you back from spending in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: By the life of God! None is despised in the eyes of his Lord on account of poverty; nay rather doth he increase in stature if He find him to be of them that endure with patience. Blessed the poor one who exerciseth patience; and woe unto the rich one who holdeth back the rights of God, the which have been enjoined upon him in His Guarded Tablet. Say: Pride not yourselves upon your material possessions: reflect upon your final objective, and that which hath been destined as the reward of your actions in the Book of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Blessed the rich one whom riches have not held back from God, the Lord of all names: he, verily, is among the choicest of creatures in the sight of the True One, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Say: The Great Day hath come, and this, truly, is the springtime of deeds, could ye but know it. Strive ye, O people, that from you may appear that which shall profit you in the worlds of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Say: Lay hold upon a praiseworthy character and goodly deeds, and be not of them that tarry. It behoveth every soul to cleave unto that whereby the Cause of God, your Lord, the Most Powerful, the Almighty, may be exalted. Say: Behold ye not this world, its vicissitudes, its variable hues, its changing aspects? How then can ye be content with it, and with aught that it containeth? Open your eyes, and be of them that gaze with discernment. It shall take them off with the speed of lightning; nay faster: to this testifieth the Lord of the kingdom in this wondrous Tablet. Shouldst thou be transported by the rapture born of the Divine Verses, render thanks, and say: "Unto Thee be praise, O Thou the Desire of all them that have sought Thee!" Rejoice thou, inasmuch as the Pen of the Most High hath turned towards thee, and sent down for thee that which the tongues of creation, nay every tongue of matchless eloquence, would be powerless befittingly to extol. Do thou greet on My behalf My loved ones, and gladden them by My remembrance of them; then read out to them My beauteous Tablet. The Glory of God rest upon thee and upon thy family, and whosoever is with thee upon My Straight Path.

He is the Conferrer of Honour

O members of the Household! There hath befallen you in the path of God that which befell the sons of the Apostle, their daughters and their womenfolk, in the Land of Taff (Karbilá) and other lands. Rest ye assured in the grace of God, and in His mercy: He, verily, is with you in every world of His worlds. He, verily, is the Beholder, the Ever-Present, the All-Seeing. Fie upon a people who wronged you, slew you, and pillaged your possessions. By My life! The people are indeed in grievous loss. The blasts of chastisement shall assail them from all sides: He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Put your trust in God, and say: "Fortunate and blessed are we for that which hath befallen us in His Straight Path. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds."

He is the Comforter in this Great and Mighty Station

O Samandar! He Who is the Supreme Ordainer doth, of a truth, comfort His own Self in that which hath befallen Him at the hands of those who chose the part of arbitrariness, and cast equity behind their backs, in consequence of having followed every rebellious demon. 'Ád and Thamúd have, verily, inflicted upon Sálih and Húd that whereat the Sadratu'l-Muntahá hath lamented, and the Concourse on high have cried out: thereto testifieth this Victim of oppression, who is beset by sorrow, and a stranger in a foreign land. I swear by God! They have crucified the Spirit (Jesus); hamstrung the She-Camel; and broken the Ark of the Covenant: thy Lord, verily, is the Expounder, the All-Informed. He, verily, mourneth His chosen ones, and comforteth His loved ones, in this calamity whereat Justice hath lamented, and the Faithful Spirit hath cried out. They have slain My chosen ones, and pillaged their possessions: thus hath it been decreed; yet the people are for the most part unaware. O Samandar! We have seen the beloved Joseph captive between the wolf's fangs, and Husayn caught in the clutches of the oppressors. By the righteousness of God! The people have committed that which neither the Jews inflicted upon the Spirit (Jesus), nor Abú-Jahl upon Muhammad Mine Apostle, Whom We adorned with the ornament of the Seal, and sent forth unto all who are in heaven and on earth. They have wrought that which none in the world hath ever wrought: unto this testifieth He Who is the Ancient King from the seat of this Majestic Vision. After Hasan and Husayn had attained their goal, and the allotted days had passed, We laid hold upon him that was the source of tyranny and injustice, through the power of Our sovereign might. Thy Lord, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Powerful. Blessed are they who draw nigh unto them, and visit them where they lie buried: these, truly, are the people of Bahá' in the kingdom of creation: thus hath it been decreed by the Pen of the Most High in this mighty and wondrous Book. Fie upon those who cast the Tablet of God behind their backs, and followed every wayward miscreant! Reflect thou, O Samandar, upon the patience I exercise notwithstanding My might; the forbearance I evince notwithstanding My power; and the silence I preserve notwithstanding the penetrative influence of My Word, which transcendeth all the worlds. Were it Our wish, We could lay hold on the oppressors in the most explicit outward sense, through the agency of one of our servants, or a company of God's favoured angels. We, verily, act in accordance with the dictates of that same wisdom which We have appointed as a lamp unto My creatures and the dwellers of My realm; thy Lord, truly, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Erelong shall We lay hold upon the workers of oppression, even as We laid hold upon them in the past. Thy Lord, verily, ordaineth what He pleaseth. God grant that thou mayest continue, as heretofore, to be graced by the tokens of God's loving-kindness, and to be occupied with His service. He, verily, testifieth on thy behalf that thou hast been faithful unto His Testament, and remained steadfast in the service of His Cause. Blessed art thou, and thy brother, and thy father who hath ascended unto God, the Lord of the worlds. O Samandar! Thou must needs proceed with the utmost caution. Credit not every speaker, neither reveal that which ye possess unto every stranger, nor disclose it unto every seeker. How many a man professeth with his tongue that whereof no thought hath entered his heart! Be thou stablished upon the throne of wisdom; walk thou in the way of wisdom; and cleave thou unto the cord of wisdom: thus biddeth thee the Lord of all creation; He, verily, is the Faithful Counsellor. In these days some, for the sake of gaining information, or for other purposes, make profession of their devotion and belief. Thou must be in all respects vigilant that naught take place outside the bounds of wisdom. For each of the souls mentioned in thy letter, wondrous and incomparable Verses have been sent down from the heaven of the Will of God. Blessed are they, for that they have been favoured with My Verses during My days, and with My mercy that hath compassed the world. Do thou make mention of thy paternal uncle on My behalf. Say thou: "Grieve not at that which hath befallen thee. The Beloved doth, verily, make mention of thee, and hath turned towards thee as a bounty on His part. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Bounteous. O Muhammad before Rahím! Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast set thy face towards God; hast hearkened unto His Call; and hast turned unto Him with a heart that is turned unto the Qiblih of the world. Beware lest the vicissitudes of the world sadden thee. The Ocean of Joy, verily, remembereth thee whilst compassed about by sorrows on every hand. The standard of oppression hath been hoisted in the Land of Sád, whereat the Tree of existence hath lamented, and the Rock of the world of being hath cried out. God hath laid hold upon the root of injustice through the power of His sovereign might. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Unrestrained. Say: 'Unto Thee be praise, O my God, for that thou hast made mention of me in Thy Most Great Prison. I ask Thee by Thy Name which overshadoweth the whole world, to write down for me by the Pen of Thy decree that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. O my Lord! Thou knowest what is in me, but I know not that which is with Thee. Thou, verily, art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.'" Now make We mention of him that hath been named Ibráhím, that he may hearken unto the Call of the All-Glorious, which hath been raised from this Exalted Spot. Do thou at all times make mention of Me, cry out in My Name, and tell forth My beauteous praise. Render thanks unto God for having aided thee to recognize the Truth, and for having sent down for thee that which shall profit thee for so long as the kingdoms of earth and heaven shall endure: provided that thou stand unwaveringly firm in this Cause, through which the feet of the learned have slipped, and the hearts of the wise have trembled, save those whom God, thy Lord and the Lord of all the worlds, hath pleased to spare. Thus hath He Who is the Dawning-place of Revelation made mention of thee during His days, that thou mayest yield thanks unto thy Most Generous Lord. Now make We mention of him that hath been named 'Alí, in this Book wherefrom the fragrance of God's holy utterance hath been diffused throughout the entire creation, and the perfume of the Divine raiment hath been wafted amongst all that are nigh unto Him. O 'Alí! We counsel thee to remain steadfast in this Mighty Cause. How many a man hath laid claim to steadfastness within himself; and who, when We assayed him through a word, faltered, and was of the lost. Abandon thou mere fancy, in the name of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, and lay hold upon the hem of certitude on the part of God, the Inaccessible, the Most Great. In such wise hath the Spirit spoken, the Bird of the Throne warbled, and the Nightingale poured forth its song. Blessed is he who inclineth, and hearkeneth, thereunto; and woe betide the heedless! The Glory of God rest upon thee, and upon all who cleave unto the Cord of God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. O Pen of the Most High! It is now Our wish to make mention of one of My maidservants, who hath given ear unto My Call; turned towards My horizon; inhaled the fragrance of My garment; arisen to commemorate and extol Me; circled around My Cause; sought the shelter of My presence; entered beneath the shadow of the tree of My loving-kindness; borne the trials of the world for love of Me and in My path; and cast away the vain imaginations of all peoples, through the power of My laws and precepts. She it is who, in the seat of this Resplendent Vision, was the consort of Our Name that was named 'Abdu'r-Rahím. O Samandar! By My life! We, verily, concealed his station in this vain life, and extolled him in My concealed and treasured Scroll in such wise that the hearts of them that are endued with understanding were enraptured. Blessed is he who was privileged to meet him during his days, or who visiteth him after his ascension: We testify that he is of the blissful. Blessed is he who approacheth and, standing before his grave, saith: "The peace of God, and of Them Who are His Chosen Ones, His Trustees, the Daysprings of His Revelation, the Dawning-places of His inspiration, the Manifestations of His Cause, and the Bearers of His throne, be upon thee, O thou light shining above the horizon of certitude, and blazoner of the praise of thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind! I testify that, upon hearing the Call, thou didst arise; didst answer thy Lord's summons; didst hasten with thine whole heart unto His Most Exalted Horizon and His Most Glorious Vision; and didst receive the choice wine of understanding from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beneficent. I testify, moreover, that thou wast steadfast in the Cause of God, in such wise that neither the clamour of the heedless, nor the blame of the ignorant, nor the estrangement of the froward, nor the protests of the malicious, nor the grunting of the wicked, nor the barking of the malevolent, could deter thee. Thou art he who was mentioned by the Pen of the Most High; was favoured with the Verses of God, the Lord of all names; and did quaff of the living waters of Divine utterance from the cup of the wisdom of God, the Lord of the worlds. I testify, furthermore, that thou didst acknowledge that which God Himself acknowledged in the Day whereon commotions seized all the dwellers of the earth, save those whom God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, was pleased to spare. Thou art he who heard in the path of God what none had heard, and bore in the love of God what none of His servants had borne before him. Thou art he who cast vain imaginings behind his back, and mere conjecture beneath his feet; and directed himself towards the Qiblih of the world with a heart sanctified from the insinuations of the deniers, and the whisperings of them that disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. Blessed art thou, and whoever draweth nigh unto thee, and visiteth thee where thou liest buried; and whoever remembereth thee, and that which befell thee at the hands of those who disbelieved in God, disputed His signs, eschewed His presence, protested against Him, and arose to put out His light, whereby both earth and heaven have been illumined: we testify that such, truly, are numbered with the companions of the Fire, in the Book of God, the King, the Just, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise." Now make We mention of Muhammad before 'Alí, whose name thou didst mention in thy letter; thy Lord, truly, is the Almighty, the All-Bounteous. Grieve not at thy separation from Us! He, verily, writeth down for whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He desireth; thy Lord, of a truth, is the Almighty, the Unrestrained. Let nothing grieve thee: rejoice rather in the days of thy Lord, and say: "Unto Thee be praise, O Thou Who art the Lord of earth and heaven! I testify that the earth hath been honoured with Thy footsteps; the air hath been graced with Thy sweet savours; the sun hath been illumined by the light of Thy Countenance; the heavens have been raised through Thy Will; the earth hath beamed at Thine appearance; and the world hath trembled in its yearning to meet Thee. O my Lord! I ask Thee by the wrongs Thou hast suffered to write down for me with Thy Most Exalted Pen that which beseemeth the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy generosity. O my Lord! I bear witness that Thou hast called me, and all things, into being for the sake of attaining unto Thy presence; of appearing before the throne of Thy majesty; and of standing at the door of Thy mercy. Yet despite my knowledge of all this, and my certainty of what Thou hast deemed acceptable before Thy Countenance, wert Thou to bid me halt, I would be content with Thy behest; and wert Thou to debar me from Thy presence, I would declare: 'Praised art Thou, and obeyed in Thy command, O Thou Who holdest in Thine hand the kingdom of all things, and wieldest in Thy grasp the empire of all names! No God is there besides Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!' O my Lord! I ask Thee by those who have arisen to assist Thy Cause, and by those at whose agonies the Concourse on high, and the dwellers of the Kingdom of Names, have lamented, to write down for me with the Pen of Thy grace the recompense of meeting Thee, and the recompense of those who hastened unto the Dayspring of Thy Revelation with such eagerness that the waves of the ocean could not deter them from following Thy path, nor could the hosts of the wicked doers debar them from attaining unto the Court of Thy grace; until they entered into Thy Most Great Prison; stood before the throne; hearkened unto Thy Call; attained the lights of Thy Countenance; and clung imploringly unto the hem of Thy bestowal. O my Lord! I am poor, and Thou art the All-Possessing; and I am impotent, while Thou art the God of power. I have lifted my suppliant hands unto the heaven of Thy bounties: shouldst Thou refuse me, Thou, truly, art the best of judges; and shouldst Thou send down upon me by Thy grace what I have wished for, Thou, truly, art the best of bestowers. I testify under all conditions that Thou art to be praised in Thy doings, and to be obeyed in Thy behest. No God is there besides Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise." O Pen of the Most Merciful! Make now mention of him that hath been named Hasan before Khán, that he may rejoice in My remembrance, and arise to discharge that which shall profit him in the worlds of My Cause, and in My glorious and sublime Kingdom. Be thou so steadfast that neither the events of the world nor the clamour of the nations shall deter thee; thus biddeth thee the Ancient King from this Resplendent Seat. Say: The heedless have, verily, imprisoned Him in this impregnable stronghold; yet under all conditions He summoneth the dwellers of the kingdom of creation unto God, the Creator of the heavens, albeit the people are for the most part unaware. Of them is he that hearkeneth, and of them is he that is heedless; of them is he that hearkeneth and turneth aside, and of them is he that hearkeneth and hasteneth to obey the summons of his Ancient Lord. This is a day whereon it behoveth the whole world to become a single ear, that it may hearken unto this Most Sweet Call, which hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven; thus affirmeth the Lord of all mankind in this mighty prison. Render thanks unto thy Lord, for that He hath made mention of thee in these Verses, whereby the eyes of them that are nigh unto God have been gladdened. O Husayn! The Face of this Wronged One hath turned towards thee from this Spot, and He saith: Blessed the stranger who hath recognized his most exalted home; the hearkener who hath heard the Call of the King of creation; the seer who hath beheld My Most Glorious Horizon; and the speaker who hath spoken forth My beauteous praise. This Wronged One, verily, calleth upon thee, and commendeth unto thee that which the All-Merciful hath sent down in His Wondrous Book. Cleave thou unto God and His commandments, and be thou so wedded thereto that all those whose sense of smell is keen may inhale from thee the fragrance of the love of God, the Lord of the worlds. Thus hath My Supreme Pen spoken as a bounty on its part, and I am the All-Bounteous, the Most Generous. O Samandar! It behoveth thee to render thanks and praise unto thy Lord, inasmuch as He hath sent down for each one of the names mentioned in thy letter that wherefrom the sincere will inhale the fragrance of My Revelation, and the perfume of My resplendent garment. The Glory of God rest upon thee, and upon them, and upon him that attained the honour of meeting and of serving Me, who is indeed none other but 'Alí after Nabíl. We, verily, make mention of him at the end of this Epistle, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of his Lord, the Lord of Utterance, the All-Informed. Over his countenance do We cast a salutation from this Spot, recalling the days when he stood before the throne, and hearkened unto the Call of his Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised. The Glory of God rest upon thee, and upon him, and upon your two families and those that are with you both, and upon those that have believed in God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He it Is That Is Manifest, and Speaketh Forth, above the Supreme Horizon

This is an Epistle from Us unto such as have cast away the world, and laid hold on whatsoever He Who is the Most Great Name hath revealed in this Day whereon the Crier hath cried out from the right hand of the snow-white Spot, announcing that the tale of sorrows hath been retold, in such wise that the Apostle hath lamented in the All-highest Paradise, and the Virgin hath wept beside the Sadratu'l-Muntahá: thus hath it been decreed by God, the Lord of Names and the Creator of the heavens, in a Scroll whereof none is informed save God, the Lord of the worlds. He it is, in truth, Who speaketh forth from His Most Great Prison, testifying to that whereunto God Himself had testified ere the creation of all things, and ere the creation of earth and heaven. O ye beloved of the All-Merciful throughout the world! By My life! The morn of utterance hath broken, and the sun of testimony hath shone with such splendour that none save those who have disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the Great, hath denied it. Although beset by sorrows on every hand, yet is the Tongue engaged in utterance; while the Pen of the Most High moveth and courseth in the arena of wisdom and understanding with such impetuosity that neither the hosts of the world, nor the imaginations of the ignorant who, without any clear proof or Book from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, pretend to learning, can arrest it. Consider ye the people and their actions. They lament and weep at that which befell the Holy Family aforetime, disavowing all connection with those who wronged them; yet perpetrate their selfsame actions, albeit they comprehend it not. The Concourse on high have stood aghast at their actions, and the Most Great Spirit and the inmates of Paradise have lamented, yet the people perceive it not. They have given themselves up to their passions, turning aside from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Thus hath this Wronged One spoken, and sent down unto you that wherefrom ye may inhale the sweet savour of God, the All-Powerful, the Loving. He, verily, loveth his loved ones, and watcheth over them from this forbidden Spot. Hearken now in the Persian tongue unto the Call of Him Whom the world hath wronged, during these days when the dark clouds of oppression have prevented the resplendent face of the daystar of justice from shedding forth its light, and when the dove of equity is sore tried in the clutches of tyranny; that perchance ye may know with absolute certainty that the trials of earth and heaven cannot restrain the Pen of the Most High from extolling God and from celebrating His praise. Under all conditions it is occupied with the mention of Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High, that perchance even one of the peoples of the earth may inhale the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful, and remain not deprived of the living ocean which hath been manifested in the name of Him Who is the Best-Beloved of all men. O friends! Although the calamity that hath befallen was, and is, most grievous, yet is He who created them well able to create others like unto them; He, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Powerful. Ye must, by the grace of God, be so steadfast in the Cause that the vicissitudes of temporal existence shall not debar you from the eternal kingdom. The earth is even such as ye have witnessed and do now witness, and no discerning person, who hath fixed his gaze upon the Most Sublime Vision, hath ever been, or ever shall be, deceived as to its true nature, inasmuch as at every moment he beholdeth how one group arriveth and another group departeth. Wherefore 'tis certain that no right-minded person hath ever been, or ever shall be, kept back thereby from the One True God. Strive that haply ye may become a means of quickening this wilting world with a new spirit. Thus commandeth you this Wronged One from this far-distant Spot. He that directed himself hither, and attained unto the presence of his Lord, made mention of you before the throne, whence We have made mention of you as a bounty on Our part, and I am the Rememberer, the All-Knowing. All of you are present before the Eye of God: He, verily, witnesseth and seeth, and He, truly, is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Rejoice ye at this Most Great Remembrance; then give praise unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, at every moment. The Glory of God rest upon you, inasmuch as ye hearkened, yet forbore; beheld, yet forewent; and witnessed that which none hath witnessed in the path of God, the All-Possessing, the All-Highest, the Ever Forgiving, the Most Bountiful. The world and all that is therein shall pass away, while that which hath been destined for you shall endure; thereto shall your names and your works be exalted on earth: thus informeth you He Who is the Truthful, the Trustworthy.

He is the All-Glorious, the Incomparable

The Bird of the Throne hath taken flight at the croaking of the raven; thy Lord, verily, is the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing. O Muhammad before Ridá! We, verily, make mention of thee in this Spot, that thou mayest rejoice at this remembrance, through which the ocean of faith hath surged, and the fragrance of the mercy of thy Lord, the Lord of Revelation, hath been wafted. Beware lest aught withhold thee from God, the Creator of the heavens! God is My witness! The Word of thy Lord is such as all the treasures of the earth can never equal: unto this testifieth He through Whom the kingdom of utterance hath been made manifest in the world of being. Although beset by sorrows on every hand, the All-Merciful yet calleth out: "No God is there but Him, the Almighty, the Unrestrained!" Naught hath prevented Him from achieving His purpose: He ordaineth as He pleaseth through the power of His sovereignty; He, of a truth, is the One, the All-Seeing. The oppressors have slain the sons of the Prophet, then make mention of Him at eventide and at dawn. The kingdoms of earth and heaven have stood bewildered at their actions. Erelong shall the blasts of chastisement overtake them from all sides: He, verily, shall lay hold upon them even as He laid hold upon others before them. Consider those who imprisoned Us in the most desolate of cities! Blessed is he that readeth the Lawh-i-Ra'ís, and learneth what proceeded from the Pen of the Most High when He was a captive in the hands of the wicked doers. The Glory of God be upon thee, and upon thy father, and upon those who have clung to the hem of grace, and have acknowledged that which God hath Himself acknowledged both in the beginning and in the end.

In the Name of Him Who is Almighty and Most Powerful

Thy letter arrived and was perused in its entirety. The people have perpetrated an injustice such as to cast the kingdoms of earth and heaven into despondency, while the Twin Lights have manifested a degree of meekness under tribulation such that the dwellers of the heavenly realm have bewailed and lamented them. Consider thou the son of Zakaríyyá, who lost his head to please the courtesan of the era; and again the scion of the Prophet, who was slaughtered at the behest of the wastrel of the age: was it they who were martyred that lost, or was it those who wronged them? -- in reply to which all things have cried out, exclaiming: "Yea, the latter are in perspicuous loss!" Although this calamity is most grievous, and the greatest abasement hath been witnessed on its account, yet, by the righteousness of God, is it in reality the mightiest honour, which hath but outwardly assumed the form of an abasement. Do thou preserve this lofty and most exalted station, nor have regard for that which is today apparent. God, verily, hath laid hold on wrongdoers in the past, and shall do so in the future; and He shall purge the earth of their like, and so raise up your station that all faces shall turn towards you, and all the tongues of the world shall recite your praise. Hearken thou unto the Call of this Wronged One, and lay fast hold on all that He hath mentioned. He, verily, is the Faithful Counsellor. See that thou spare no effort in doing all thou canst to protect the people's claims upon the King of Martyrs, forasmuch as this matter is acceptable and pleasing in the sight of God, and a cause of exaltation and advancement. Do thou on behalf of this Wronged One make mention of all the relatives, and speak unto them words of consolation. He, verily, is the Comforter, the All-Knowing. God willing, thou wilt remain, as heretofore, beneath the glances of God's loving providence. Rest assured, and be thou of the thankful. That which is incumbent upon thee is to ensure the contentment of the family of the Twin Martyrs -- may the Glory of God rest upon them. Wert thou to ponder a while, thou wouldst know of a certainty that what hath befallen is, and ever shall be, an inestimable honour. Unto this testifieth He Who hath knowledge of the Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of Lords.

In the Name of the One, All-Seeing God

O My leaf, and the leaf of My Divine Lote Tree! The winds of malice have arisen, and from the Lote Tree of the Cause have fallen leaves for whom the Beloved (Muhammad) hath lamented, the Friend (Abraham) hath cried out, and Gabriel hath announced: "The torment hath been made ready for you, O ye people of malice!" Please God, thou wilt attain unto His special favour, and find solace in the remembrance of Him. Notwithstanding that this supreme calamity transcendeth all calamities, yet did the best of mortals lose his head and lay down his life in the way of the Ancient King. Although outwardly this matter seareth the heart, yet is it, and shall it ever be, the means and cause of the growth of the Divine Lote Tree. I swear by the Daystar of Truth, which today shineth above the horizon of the Revelation, that were the full glory of this station to be disclosed, all the friends would direct themselves towards the place of sacrifice, nor accept a ransom. Thy letter arrived and was perused. Thou hast ever been, and shalt ever be, beneath the glances of the gracious providence of the True One; and whatsoever wisdom dictateth, the same shall flow forth from the heaven of God's Command. Rejoice thou in My Revelation; in My stablishment upon the throne; in My Call; in My remembrance; and in My praise. Thy Lord, truly, is the Ever-Observant, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. His honour the Afnán -- upon him be of all glories the Most Glorious -- is present before My Face, and God sendeth down from the heaven of His bounty that which hath been destined for him. He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Be thou in no wise sorrowed, and hold fast, as bidden, unto the cord of patience. He, verily, will make manifest that which shall rejoice the hearts of those who have been afflicted with sorrows by reason of that which the hands of rebellion have wrought. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Powerful. The Glory of God rest upon you all, and upon those maidservants who have believed in Him Who is the Incomparable, the All-Knowing.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Great

Say: Glory be to Thee, O God, the Lord of all things, and Creator of all Names! I ask Thee by that Name whereby all idols have been shattered, and through which all vain imaginations have passed away, to immerse me in the ocean of certitude, O Thou Who art the Lord of Revelation! O my Lord! Assist me to perform that which Thou hast desired, through the power of Thy sovereignty, and which Thou hast sent down in Thine unerring Book. O my Lord! This is a day wherewith the Scriptures of the world, and the Books which Thou didst send down upon Thy Messengers and Thy Chosen Ones, have been adorned. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the drops sprinkled by the ocean of Thy grace, nor to cast me out of the door which Thou hast opened before all who are in Thy heaven and all who are on Thine earth. O my Lord! I am weak: yet have I laid hold upon Thy Name, the Powerful, the Mighty. Do Thou destine for me by Thy grace that which shall profit me both in this world and in the world to come. Thou, verily, art the Great Giver, the All-Bountiful, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Great

O Varqá! The servant in attendance hath come before Us, and presented that which thou didst set forth in thy letter. We, truly, found it to be a mirror reflective of thy love for Him Who is the Beloved of the world, and of thy turning unto Him. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast drawn nigh, hast quaffed thy fill, and hast attained unto thine object. Thy Lord, verily, is the Expounder, the Most Manifest. We have beheld the fire that hath surrounded thee in the love of thy Lord, and We have seen its blaze and heard its roaring. Exalted be He Who ignited it, Who kindled it and Who brought it into being! He, verily, is the Almighty, before the revelation of Whose power the very essence of power hath confessed its impotence. Thy Lord, verily, heareth and seeth; He truly is the All-Informed. Rejoice thou for that this Wronged One remembereth thee, as He hath remembered thee aforetime, and as He doth so now, while He paceth, saying: "I have perceived the fragrance of thy love, and have observed thy sincerity and thy submissiveness whensoe'er thine heart is occupied with My remembrance, and thy tongue engaged in speaking forth My beauteous praise." Thus hath the Ocean of Life imparted a sprinkling of its moisture, that thou mayest rejoice during the days of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Wondrous. O Varqá! Thy call was heard, and thy letter was presented before the throne. Praise be to God! The brands of the love of God were perceived therefrom. Please God, thou wilt ever continue, as heretofore, to delight in the mention of the Beloved, to drink in His Name, to rest in His remembrance, and to be occupied with the thought of Him, that perchance the remote may draw nigh unto the ocean of nearness, and the languid may be stimulated by the heat of the Divine Word to hasten unto that quarter which is sanctified above all other quarters. Some of those whose hearts are turned towards Him appear to have been saddened, nay affrighted, by the incident that hath transpired in the Land of Sád; whereas in reality all that hath befallen is that the Hand of Divine power hath, as a special favour, raised them up, and, from the heaven of mercy and the cloud of bounty, rained down upon them showers of grace and blessing. His consummate power hath adorned them amongst all people with the ornament of honour, whence their praise is now sung by the tongues of the sincere, and of all such as have drawn nigh unto God. They attained a station such that even their enemies testified to the loftiness of their rank; while at the end of their days they attained the most sublime and lofty of all stations, which is that of Supreme Sacrifice. This is a station which the saints and chosen ones of God have from everlasting sought and hoped for, as they do so still, and shall for evermore. This notwithstanding, some appear to be dejected and despondent. God willing, such feelings have arisen out of love for them. I swear by the ocean of true understanding that were the station of one of their servants, who is even now engaged in service, to be revealed, the peoples of the earth would be astounded. Blessed is he who pondereth over what hath come to pass, that he may become acquainted with the greatness of the Cause, and its sovereign might. This station which they attained they themselves had craved of the True One -- exalted and glorified be He -- and had sought and hoped for with the utmost fervour and longing. Say: O friends! Much have ye suffered for the love of Him Who is the Beloved of the worlds! Ye have witnessed, and seen, that which it was not meet should be seen, and ye have heard that which it was not fitting should be heard. In the pathway of the Friend, ye have borne things that were in truth more crushing than the mountains. Blessed be your backs, your eyes, and your ears, for that which they have borne, seen, and heard. Now, do ye appreciate the excellence of this lofty and most exalted station, and see that ye do naught to dim its lustre. Whate'er betide, the claws of death shall fasten upon this perishable world, and all that are in it; while whatsoever it containeth shall be afflicted in the clutches of change. Do ye beseech at all times the One True God -- exalted and glorified be He -- to preserve you, and to keep you steadfast upon His Straight Path. Know ye this much, that whatsoever ye have borne, or seen and heard, for His sake, the same is but a token of His grace and loving providence, wherewith ye have been especially favoured. This mention of you that He maketh in the Tablets is, and ever shall be, another instance of His grace. Ye have tasted of the chalice of affliction in His path: quaff ye then the choicest wine from the goblets of His mention and His favours. Please God, ye will be graciously enabled to serve the Cause; thereto We commend unto all a praiseworthy character, goodly deeds, and a seemly and acceptable demeanour. In this day, it is incumbent upon everyone to cleave, and have recourse, to whatsoever shall exalt the Cause of God. Say: This much We say, and for the rest leave it to your sense of equity to judge what should befit a day such as this. Be ye not saddened by outward frailty, abasement and disarray. I swear by the daystar of the heaven of self-sufficiency that honour and riches circle around you, sing your praise, and incline in your direction. If, pursuant to the dictates of Divine wisdom, the appearance thereof should remain for a few days hidden, yet days shall come when each one of you will appear manifest and resplendent as the sun. We beseech the One True God that the people may discover the sweetness of the Divine utterances, and truly savour it. The Glory of Our presence rest upon thee, and upon thy brother, and upon My Name who laid down his life in My path, and hath rested in the precincts of My mercy. We, verily, mention at the end of this Epistle thy brother, who hath turned his face unto My Face, stood before the door of My majesty, and hearkened unto My mighty and wondrous Call. God willing, that which hath been mentioned will not depart from his eyes: he will rest assured in the loving providence of God, quaff at all times the choice wine of His remembrance, and fix his gaze upon His court. God willing, the matter of love and unity also will not be overlooked. We make mention at this juncture of him that hath been named Kázim, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Blessed art thou, and thy brother, who was martyred in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. Consider thou, and bethink thee of, Our servant Kázim who suffered in the Land of Sád a martyrdom so grievous that all the atoms of the universe, and beyond them the Concourse on high and the dwellers of the Cities of Names, bewailed his agony. Unto this testifieth thy Lord, the Witness, the All-Informed. O Kázim! Reflect thou upon the loving providence of the True One; behold His mercy, which hath encompassed all peoples; and contemplate that blessed Word which was sent down in the Epistle to Há' and Sín. He said, and truly did He speak: "Whoso is for God, God is for him." Since, therefore, it was in the pathway of the King of eternal glory that those sanctified souls renounced the world and all its peoples, and won the cup of martyrdom -- which is in reality the winning arrow -- for this reason is the Pen of the Most High seen at each dawn and eventide to be occupied with their remembrance, and restless in its exposition of this theme. I swear by the sun of the kingdom of utterance that if the shrilling voice of the Pen of the Most High were truly hearkened unto with a listening ear, all would hasten forth from their habitations, and cry aloud "Here am I, O Lord my God, here am I!" Blessed the ear that hath hearkened; the heart that hath apprehended that which hath flowed forth; and the palate that hath savoured all that hath been made manifest of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful. O Kázim! Do even as thou hast been bidden, and thou shalt behold the loving-kindness of thy Lord, which pervadeth all the worlds. The Glory of God be upon thee, and upon those who have attained the bounty of manifesting the Most Great Steadfastness in this Cause, through which the mountains have been scattered in dust, the heavens have been cleft asunder, the earth hath been rent in twain, and all God's servants have trembled, save only those whom God, the Almighty, the Protector, the Powerful, was pleased to spare.

He is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious

A remembrance from Us unto him that hath hearkened unto My Call, and whose response to the Lord of all mankind We have heard, that he may be overtaken by the joy born of Mine utterance, notwithstanding that sorrows have encompassed the entire creation. O thou proclaimer of My Cause, and beholder of My Countenance! Grieve not at that which hath befallen the Cause: thy Lord, truly, lieth in wait. He shall lay hold on the wrongdoers, even as He laid hold on him that was their chief; He, truly, is severe in punishing! They have kindled with their own hands the fire of affliction; yet are the people in a wondrous stupor! So besotted have they become in the drunkenness of their evil passions that they have perpetrated that whereat the cloud hath cried out. Say: Was it Hasan who disbelieved in God, or was it that which he possessed? If it was he, why then didst thou pillage his possessions, O thou false dissembler? Think they that they will consume what they have amassed? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of Lords! They have committed that whereat the inmates of the Kingdom have lamented, and beyond them the Day of Reckoning. O My companion! Consider thou, and reflect upon, the grace of God, and His loving-kindness. He, verily, raised them up in truth, and adorned them with the best of ornaments. He so ennobled them that men's tongues spake forth their praise; He honoured them with that Supreme Sacrifice which hath from everlasting been the hope of them that have drawn nigh unto Him; and the Pen of God hath been moved to commemorate them in such wise that all hearts have melted. The servant in attendance hath come before Our Countenance, and read out that wherewith thou didst call upon this Wronged One; and We have answered thee with this Epistle. Beware lest aught sadden thee; thereto admonish My branches, and those who have sought My Countenance, that it may bring them joy after their sorrows. The Glory of God rest upon thee, and upon whosoever reflecteth upon that which hath been revealed by God, the Lord of the Return. This is that which was sent down in reply from God, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful. O Javád! The epistle which his honour 'Alí before Akbar -- upon him be the Glory of God -- wrote unto thee was presented in its entirety before the Divine Countenance by the servant in attendance, and granted the honour of an attentive hearing. The beginning of the letter was adorned with expressions of homage, praise, gratitude and thanksgiving unto Him Who is the Beloved of the world. Blessed the tongue that hath in this day made mention of Him; the heart that hath attained unto His love; the eyes that have been privileged to behold the Most Sublime Vision; the face that hath turned unto the Face of God, the Supreme Ordainer; and the Pen that hath been moved to extol and to praise Him. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken in this noble habitation. Howbeit certain remarks were observed at the end thereof which bespoke feelings of sorrow, and were unworthy of these days; among others the following expressions had been employed: "...especially in these days when God hath so willed it that these servants should become the objects of whatever trials descend and calamities befall." He had likewise used other expressions yet more grievous, or at least similar, in tenor. Yea, in the path of God the believers have been imprisoned; taunted by their enemies; and afflicted by calamities. Yet all these matters do not equal a single letter of the Verses which had erewhile been sent down from the Dayspring of God's loving-kindness especially for him, and for those who had been privileged to suffer calamities in My path; and which We had ordered the servant in attendance, after having written them out, to despatch from hence. How strange that, after hearkening unto those Verses, whose fragrance hath intoxicated and delighted the Concourse on high, he should have occupied himself with such expressions, and sent them to the Holy Land! By the righteousness of God! All that hath been created on earth doth not equal a single letter thereof! Were that Tablet to be recited before those who are nigh unto God, and truly devoted to His Cause, they would of a surety be so inebriated by the choice wine of the All-Merciful as to renounce the world and all its peoples; and had they eternity to live, then ever, so long as life endured, would they repeat: "Praise be to Thee!" "Glory be to Thee!" "Thanks be to Thee!" and "Bounty be to Thee!" Although the incident of the Land of Sád was a cause and occasion for the hearts of them that are nigh unto God, and of the sanctified, to be consumed, yet had it been imagined that, after witnessing the sun-like favours shining above the horizon of the gracious providence of the Pen of God, all would beseech and hope that they too might attain unto a dewdrop from this same ocean. In such days as these it behoveth one who, like his honour, hath ever been under the glances of God's loving-kindness, and hath attained unto a position of nearness, to speak such words as shall cause tepid souls to be set on fire, and occasion tranquillity to troubled hearts. In days gone by many such matters took place -- nay, yet more grievous and distressful -- as he himself hath seen and heard. A considerable period hath now elapsed during which the like events have but seldom come to pass; this notwithstanding, most seem perturbed, affrighted, confused and sorrowful. These Twin Luminaries, meaning Há' and Há', bent their course towards 'Iráq; attained the ocean of God's presence; and drank their fill of the living waters of reunion. In those days they were unknown, save to a handful of souls; but after being graced by God's bountiful favour they became known and celebrated among the whole company of those who are nigh unto Him, and truly devoted to His Cause, nay among the Celestial Concourse itself. At the end of their days they attained unto that Supreme Sacrifice which, in their letters to the True One -- exalted and glorified be He -- they themselves had sought and hoped for; while touching that which befell them, words were sent down from the Pen of the Most High that shall abide and endure for as long as the kingdoms of earth and heaven shall last. By thy life, O 'Alí! This is a cause for thanks -- but thanks of a kind wherefrom the very ocean of good pleasure is apparent. The groaning and lamentation of the Pen of the Most High have been, and ever shall be, in token of His loving-kindness, His grace, and His fidelity; for otherwise the Divine Lote Tree is exalted through the blood of His chosen ones. In fine, abasement in My path is the king of honours; poverty in My love hath ever been, and ever shall be, the prince of riches; and death in My good pleasure is the dawning-place of life. Take good heed, then, O ye who are endued with understanding hearts; and mark ye well that which hath been uttered, O ye who are endued with vision!

In a Blessed Tablet addressed to Hakím Áqá Ján Tabíb-i-Hamadání, the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- says the following:

For whatever property hath been plundered in the Land of Sád, and for each drop of blood that hath been unjustly shed therein, innumerable souls have departed from this world, and shall depart hereafter, and so likewise with respect to possessions. Sleep hath not overtaken the One True God, nor ever shall it. He is awake and aware, and the wrongdoers shall assuredly taste the bitter fruits of their actions. Through the appearance of but one of the deeds of the She-Serpent, the second 'Ubaydu'lláh hath been made manifest; and he hath committed that wherefrom the first 'Ubaydu'lláh shrank. "God's malison upon the people of tyranny!" Naught hath betided in this world, nor ever shall it, without an attendant cause and fruit. Reflect thou how many souls have perished, and how many lands and cities have returned to dust, whereof naught is now seen but a level plain. The lot of today is even this; and hereafter the True One knoweth what shall come to pass. Nor think that, in the midst of this, the friends of God have been slain by the swords of the oppressors. I swear by the sun of the kingdom of truthfulness that each one of the friends of God who quaffed in that incident the draft of martyrdom ascended unto the throne of the Most High, and rested and reposed beneath the shade of the canopy of Divine mercy. Were those stations to reveal their splendour to the extent even of a needle's eye, all would raise the cry "Would I had been with him!" Whatsoever outward loss hath been sustained by any of the friends, the same was then, and remaineth now, pure gain. The people of Bahá have ever been, as they are today, assured of mighty gain. If, pursuant to the dictates of Divine wisdom, for a fleeting day, or over a certain limited period, some loss should be incurred, it behoveth not to grieve thereat. Assuredly the One True God shall adorn it with the ornament of the greatest gain. He, verily, is the True One, and He is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, and the All-Wise.

In a Tablet addressed to their honours the Afnáns, the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His Glory -- says:

O My Name! The incident of the Land of Sád is remembered before the Countenance of God as among the greatest of calamities, whence till now well nigh a hundred Tablets have been revealed from the world of Divine providence, and flowed forth from the Pen of the Most High, in remembrance of him, and of those who were with him. No one hath attained unto such an outpouring of grace. Unto this testifieth that which the Most Merciful hath sent down in the Tablets. By Thy might! The inmates of My Kingdom and My Realm of Glory, and the dwellers of the Tabernacle of My Holiness, have bewailed and lamented his and their sufferings. Howbeit this blessed Word appeared aforetime from the Dayspring of God's Light:

> O ransom of God! Shouldst thou be slain for love *
>
> Flinch not, and yield thy soul for the sake of love!

Whatsoever befell those consecrated souls in the way of God hath assuredly not been without effect, and the fruit thereof will assuredly appear. Do thou inform My branches of that whereof thou hast been informed by Him Who is the All-Informed.

Section Six

Tablets Revealed in Honour of the Relatives

Of the Twin Shining Lights

O Ibráhím! Hearken thou unto the Call of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, which hath been raised from His most sublime and lofty Station. He, verily, will confirm thee in that which beseemeth the days of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thou art he who directed his steps towards the Supreme Horizon, and who visited the Spot wherein the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: "The Kingdom is God's, the Lord of the worlds!" Blessed is every face that hath turned unto the Face of God; and the heart that hath attained unto His love, the Most Precious. Lay thou hold upon the Sure Handle, and say: "O Lord of the throne above and of earth below! I ask Thee by Thy Name through which the Supreme Horizon hath been illumined, to assist me to serve Thee in such wise that I may move according to Thy will, and breathe by Thy leave and at Thy pleasure. Thou, verily, art the Almighty, before Whom all things have bowed; and the Sovereign to Whom all that are in heaven and on earth have submitted. O my Lord! Behold Thou Thy lovers in Thy lands, who have trembled at the onslaught of Thine enemies. I beseech Thee, by the light of Thy Countenance and the fire of Thy love, so to attract them by Thine utterance that they may not be affected by Thine enemies, and by the estrangement of the learned amongst Thy creatures who pretend to knowledge without any clear proof from Thee, or testimony on Thy part. O my Lord! I am a suppliant, and Thou art the Answerer of prayers; and I am a poor creature, and Thou art the All-Possessing. Deal with me then as befitteth Thy majesty and Thy sovereignty. Thou, truly, art the Almighty, the Most Powerful."

He is the Expounder, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise

O Ibráhím! Hearken thou unto the call of the Friend (Abraham): He, of a truth, crieth out to thee from this Vale which hath been named "Nabíl" in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. He, verily, remembereth thee as a bounty on His part, that thou mayest make good what hath escaped thee in the days of God, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Reflect thou upon that which hath been manifested in truth, and say: "I ask Thee, O Thou Maker of the heavens and Lord of all names, by Thy Name whereby Thou hast subdued all things, to grant that I may understand that from which the learned of the lands and the wise of Thy realm have been veiled. O my Lord! I am the one whom Thou didst cause to hearken unto Thy Most Exalted Call when it was raised from Thy Most Sublime Horizon; yet interposing veils prevented me from turning with my whole being unto Thee: wherefore I was deprived of the soft-flowing stream of Thine utterance, and the living waters of Thy knowledge. O my God, O my God! Thy grace is my highest aspiration, and Thy forgiveness my fondest hope, my deepest longing, and my dearest wish. I ask Thee by the sun of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy bestowal graciously to aid me to accomplish that which is pleasing and acceptable unto Thee. Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou holdest in Thine hands the reins of all things. No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bounteous." O Ibráhím! Wert thou, rid of attachment unto all things, to cry out but once, assuredly thou wouldst hear the response. Today, the heaven of Divine bounty hath been raised, and assuredly if a soul but turn unto God in a befitting manner he shall not remain deprived. I commend unto thee that wherewith the One True God -- exalted be His glory -- hath admonished His servants in all the Holy Scriptures. Do thou lay aside whatsoever preventeth thee from recognizing God and His Cause. O Ibráhím! Cast off thy self, then turn with thine whole heart unto the horizon through which the faces of the sincere have been illumined. This is the Day whose station hath been mentioned and set down in all the Holy Books. Should any matter escape one, never shall he be able to make it good! Close thine eyes to the people, that thou mayest behold the Face of the Loved One, abiding after the evanescence of all things. By the righteousness of God! Great, immeasurably great is this Cause; and He that admonisheth thee wholly for the sake of God is, verily, the Faithful Counsellor. Strive thou that the clay clods of the earth may not deprive thee of the blooms of Divine mysteries. Truly, it is a matter of astonishment that although none is informed of the root of this Cause, yet whatsoever is manifest among the people deriveth from this station, pursuant to a wisdom whereof none hath been informed save Him Who is the All-Informed; howbeit most people have remained deprived and oblivious thereof. Say: O servants! The darkness of your deeds hath obscured the world. Strive ye to attain unto the true brightness. Of a certainty words can never take the place of deeds. Cling ye to goodly and praiseworthy deeds, and purge and sanctify yourselves from the defilement of whatsoever is subject to the Divine prohibitions, in order that ye may attain unto true composure. By My life! I speak not from mere impulse: unto this testifieth all who have been ennobled by the quality of fair-mindedness in the kingdom of creation. Peace be upon whosoever followeth the way of guidance, and pondereth upon all matters. Do thou embrace whatsoever shall draw thee nigh unto the Straight Path of God.

*His honour Mírzá Sádiq, upon him be the Glory of God*

He is God, exalted be He; grandeur and utterance are His estate. Sád, Dál, Qáf. The memorial of the mercy of God unto the one who quaffed the choice wine of belief, and turned unto the horizon of Him Who is the Most Compassionate, holding fast unto His cord, clinging to the hem of His robe, steadfastly serving His Cause, and gazing upon the lights of His Countenance, until he arrived in His presence, and attained unto that which the Most Compassionate hath sent down in the Furqán, and in the Evangel, the Torah and the Psalms. The Tongue of Grandeur testifieth, of Himself and by Himself, that there is no God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. He hath come down from the heaven of Proof with the standards of Perspicuous Utterance. Blessed be whoever witnesseth, and answereth His summons, and woe betide every heedless one, shut out as by a veil! O thou who hast come before this Wronged One, and dwellest now in His vicinity! He, verily, beareth witness that thou hast attained unto the Divine presence, and set thyself towards the True One at a time when all men have turned aside, except such as God, the Lord of all that was and shall be, was pleased to guide. Thou hast directed thy footsteps unto the Furthermost Goal and the Loftiest Summit, and hast soared up on the wings of detachment to the Lord of all creation, until thou didst stand before a Gate that hath been flung open before the dwellers of both the seen and the unseen realms. Render thou thanks unto God for that the Pen of the Most High so testifieth of thee on this moonlit night, when the Wronged One is seated upon His throne, and uttereth that which draweth the people nigh unto a glorious station. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast chosen thy destination, and set out upon thy journey, in such wise that neither the vagaries of the rulers nor the veils of the learned could deter thee; and hast left thy home trusting wholly in God, thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Loving. We pray God to confirm and assist thee to do that which is pleasing and acceptable unto Him; and to cause to appear from thee in the world that which shall last as long as His Most Excellent Names and His Most Exalted Attributes shall last. Powerful is He to do that which He pleaseth through His word "Be," and it is. Praise be to God that thou hast hearkened, hast attained, and hast set thyself towards Him at a time when all have risen up to oppose Him. I beseech the One True God graciously to assist thee to preserve this most exalted station. He is the Almighty, the Most Powerful. The letter his honour Amín -- upon whom be My glory and My loving-kindness -- sent to thee was perused. The love and affection he expressed for thee and the members of thy household occasioned joy and gladness. We pray God to assist and succour him. He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. In truth, his honour Amín is steadfast in faith, and constant in rendering service. Blessed are they who are adorned with the adornment of love for the Twin Martyrs, for thee, and for thy kindred. Ye, verily, have an eminent position in the sight of God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed be whoever turneth towards you; attaineth the bounty of your love; and heareth that which your tongue uttereth concerning the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Wise. The Glory of Our presence rest upon you, and upon Amín, and upon all that are staunch and steadfast, and all that are unwaveringly firm in their belief, and faithful to their trust.

In the Name of God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Power and Might

Praise be to God, the All-praised King, the Lord of the heavens of grace and bounty, Who created all existence; brought forth the mysteries of the unseen into the world of the seen; vouchsafed unto the people the promise of the Signal Day; and announced unto them the tidings of the appearance of the Promised Hour. When the veil was rent asunder; the secret of the Return was revealed; the veil of concealment was removed from the face of the mysteries of the Beginning in the Day of Turning back; and the realities of knowledge, as imparted in the Holy Scriptures and the Book of God, were sent down from Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Bounteous, the hearts of those endued with understanding were drawn towards the Lord of the Day of Reckoning so that they penetrated, through the power of the Sovereign Ordainer and the Creator of mankind, the Most Great Veil; turned with their whole hearts unto the most manifest yet abstruse Mystery; recognized the most sublime Embellished Symbol; and discerned Thy glorious, Thy most hidden, Thy most manifest, and Thy most resplendent Beauty. When, with nimble steps, they circled about this fire, and, through the power of Him Who is the Lord of the heaven of might, obtained their share of illumination from the lights of the Lote Tree of the Cause, the hearts of the wicked trembled, and, raising aloft the standards of hate and enmity toward God's righteous servants, they forbade them from directing their steps towards their Lord, the Almighty, the Unconstrained. Say: For how long will ye thus speed through the wildernesses of your idle fancies? The Hidden Secret hath been made manifest; the veil hath been lifted from the face of the Treasured Symbol; and the cloud hath been dispelled from before the beauty of the Preserved Light. Is it passion that hath kept you back from Him Who is the Lord of this world and of the next? Do ye protest against the people of perception because they have directed themselves towards their Lord, the Sovereign Liege of all men? Should the people of discernment hesitate to approach the precincts of that sanctuary wherein lieth their salvation? Nay, by Him from Whom is the beginning, and unto Whom is the return! Can anyone intimidate the truly pious? Say: Do ye threaten them with affliction in the path of God, the Lord of all names? These, verily, are a people who have accepted trials and tribulations; and who, in their eagerness to gain admission into the kingdom of eternity, have welcomed with their breasts the shafts of the enemies' assault. I swear by the Lord of creation! Such presumption on your part portendeth naught but heedlessness and loss. Should ye, with the swords of hatred and oppression, hew into pieces the bodies of them that gain admission into the heaven of belief, still would ye be unable to hinder them from following the way of certitude. Say: The Path hath appeared; the Proof hath been perfected; and the thirsty one hath hastened unto the stream of knowledge flowing from the Eye of Sád, which welleth out beneath the throne of Him who is the Lord of the Day of Return. Blessed are ye, O people of affection, for that ye have entered the Tabernacle of Holiness in the Kingdom of Righteousness. Through your steadfastness the hearts of the people of malice have trembled, and through your constancy upon the path of the Cause the limbs of the people of oppression and mischief have quaked. O my God, my Possessor, and my King! There is no land throughout Thy dominions that hath not been dyed crimson with the blood of Thy chosen ones, nor any tree that hath not been honoured with the bodies of Thy saints. They have borne that which hath caused the tears of the dwellers of the Tabernacle of Thy glory to flow at even and at morn; and they have suffered at the hands of the heedless that which hath caused the eyes of all who are in the heaven of Thy Cause to weep sore at daybreak and at dusk. Thou well knowest that they have harboured no purpose in Thy realm except to eradicate sedition from among Thy servants; to adorn their bodies with the robes of love and unity; and to crown their heads with the diadems of harmony and affection. For Thou hast not enjoined upon them in this Dispensation but to exhaust their energies in removing hate and rancour, and to expend their efforts in eliminating dissension, and in promoting love and unity throughout all regions. Amongst the people are those who protested against them for turning towards Thee, and for seeking illumination from the light of Thy knowledge; who passed upon them the sentence of impiety and misbelief; and who pronounced lawful the shedding of their blood, thereby rebelling against Thy sovereignty, and grievously transgressing against Thy subjects. Amongst them are those who accused them of wreaking disorder throughout the lands, thereby causing them to become victims of adversity, and objects of alternating happiness and distress. Thou dost bear witness -- yea all the atoms of the earth attest -- that never was it their intention to wreak disorder in Thy realm; and that they have not walked but in the pathway of Thy Cause, which is even for them to be united upon Thine earth, and to love their fellows among Thy creatures. Do their patience over successive years; their endurance of every hardship; their obedience of every order, not yet suffice? I swear by Thine own exalted Self, and by Thy proof which prevaileth over all created things! Were the heedless to show forth equity to an extent smaller than a needle's eye, they would behold that they have purposed naught but to compass the good of all; to achieve the welfare of the masses; to purge Thy land of dissension and division; and to adorn it with the evidences of friendliness and concord. For everything there is a sign in Thy realm, and the sign of their sincerity is the manner of their comportment throughout this period, and the patience they have exercised in the midst of hardship. I beseech Thee, O my Begetter, by Thy Name which hath subdued the whole world, and which hath overshadowed all the nations, to lift from their eyes the veil of ignorance, that they may apprehend Thy purpose in sending down Thy laws and ordinances, and revealing Thy commandments in Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets: for Thou art powerful to do as Thou willest, and supreme over all that Thou desirest. No God is there beside Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the Peerless. O thou who seekest the shadow of the Lote Tree of the Cause, and who dwellest in the meads of bounty and grace! I have recognized the ardour of thy love for God, and the depth of thy devotion to His Countenance. I beseech God, thy Lord, and the Lord of all things, to assist thee at all times; to nourish thee from the stream of bounty and benevolence; and to cause thee to attain unto the highest levels of knowledge and understanding. Consider thou the world, and the evidences of discord rife within it; and reflect upon that which the Tongue of the Will of God hath spoken concerning the desirability of friendliness and unity. The people, truly, have conceived this Mighty Cause and Momentous Enterprise to be a source of mischief and disunity; notwithstanding that the Divine Law commandeth not the creatures but unto affection and the relinquishment of malice. Say: This is a Cause whereby God will make manifest the spiritual characteristics and heavenly acquirements that are latent within man. Therein hath He entertained no other purpose but to induce a progression unto the highest levels of knowledge, and to effect a conquest of the loftiest pinnacle of advancement in the degrees of man. Say: Through it the hyacinths of certitude shall spring up in the earth of the hearts, and the trees of existence shall give forth the blossoms of Divine mysteries and holy utterance in commemoration of the All-Merciful, and in confession of the unity of His Holiness, the All-Glorious. O spiritual friend! Some time hath passed during which, in consequence of a journey, no letter was despatched. The One True God testifieth, and is my witness, that at no time wast thou forgotten; nor, God willing, shalt thou be hereafter. At one of the stages in the journey a letter of thine was perused, and a brief reply was written and sent off. When subsequently admission was gained into the Holy Presence, thy remembrance flowed forth from the Tongue of Grace, and such a demonstration of loving-kindness was witnessed in thy behalf that the pen and the tongue are powerless and inadequate to express or reckon it. Blessed art thou! And again blessed art thou! In truth, the favours of the Ancient King have, in this Most Mighty Revelation, so encompassed His loved ones as to be beyond the ability of anyone, whatever their powers of expression or inquiry, to describe or reckon. It behoveth us to render thanks unto God, the Lord of the realm on high, the King of Glory and Divinity, for as long as the kingdoms of earth and heaven shall endure. Ere this servant had departed on his journey, a Tablet was vouchsafed thee from the Source of loving-kindness; yet in view of certain prudential considerations a delay was incurred in its despatch. Now, in view of the issuance of an unequivocal command, it is enclosed herewith. I beseech God to honour thee with beholding it, even as He had honoured thee with its revelation, in order that the bounty may be perfected, and thine eye may be solaced through the loving-kindness of Him Who is the Lord of the kingdom of bounty and justice. Do thou, on behalf of this servant, convey to the friends of God a matchless and wondrous salutation, and say: "The One True God -- exalted be His glory -- hath in each of the Dispensations of the Manifestations of His own Self reserved trials and tribulations for His loved ones, and destined the detritus of the world for the malevolent and the heedless, appointing afflictions as the test and touchstone of His loved ones, even as He hath said aforetime: 'And We shall try you with somewhat of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth and lives and fruits, etc.' It behoveth you at all times to cling to the cord of steadfastness, and to hold fast the hem of grace. The evanescence of the world, and the ephemerality of all things in it, are matters about which there is no doubt, and no right-minded person will set his heart upon that which must inevitably pass away, nor will he rest satisfied and content with the ease of a few fleeting days. What sapient traveller would be content with the embellishments of the stages in his journey, and forego arrival at his home and destination? Nay, by God! Never will those endued with understanding be debarred by any obstacle, or kept back by even the most refined of this world's perishable benefits from arriving at their ultimate destination and Divine home. We beseech the One True God -- exalted be His glory -- and entertain of Him the hope, that He will at all times dignify His loved ones with the mantle of steadfastness, and, in the midst of suffering, keep them as firm and constant as the immovable mountains. Although, by reason of the succession of afflictions, the body be overcome by sickness, yet shall this pass away, and an everlasting dominion, and a universal and abiding rest and good, ensue. I admonish you, O ye loved ones of God, to guard the pearls of the love of God that ye possess, for thieves lie in wait, and bide their time to divest you of that wherewith ye have been distinguished amongst men. O that the people might know! By God! Were they to apprehend the truth, then would they understand what ye possess, and would offer up their lives in their longing to attain the wonders of the mysteries of knowledge that ye have known, and in their eagerness to acquire the gems of the secrets of certitude which God hath bestowed upon you. Say: 'O Thou Who art the God of all men, and the Lord of the mystery of destiny! We beseech thee by Thy sovereignty which overpowereth the whole world, and by Thy Proof which is manifest among the nations, graciously to aid us to remain steadfast in Thy Cause, through whose appearance the feet of the stalwart have slipped, and the limbs of the resolute have quaked. O Lord! We are weak, and Thou art the Most Powerful, the Almighty. Look not upon us with the eye of justice, but rather with the glances of loving-kindness and grace. Hold then our hands with the hand of Thy bestowal; save us from those floundering in the sloughs of remoteness and deprivation; and deliver us from the guile of those who have strayed far from the shore of the stream of faith. O Thou Who art our God, and the Subjugator of men's necks! Do thou acquaint Thy servants with that which Thou hast distinguished us withal throughout Thy lands, that they may know that we have not purposed to wreak disorder, neither hast Thou commanded us thereunto in Thy Books and Thy Tablets, but rather unto the dissemination of the traces of affection, and the adornment of the world with the robes of friendliness and unity, O Thou Who art the Lord of all men, and the King of the Day of Reckoning!'" We beseech the One True God -- exalted be His grandeur -- to preserve thee at all times, and to enable thee to accomplish that which is purely good. Rest thou assured in the grace of God, and His loving-kindness: He, verily, is with thee, and shall destine for thee all good in His Book. Write thou ever an account of thy circumstances, and despatch it hither; thereto fix thy gaze at all times upon wisdom. He hath said aforetime: "Despair ye not of the mercy of God!" Upon thee be the Glory of God, and His Spirit; and likewise upon those friends of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great, who are with thee. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

From the Most Pure Pen of the Centre of the Covenant, Exalted Be His Praise

He is God

O beloved in the spirit! On this brightsome morn, moved by thy heavenly love, and through the good offices of the attracted leaves, Rúhá Khánum and Khánum Díyá', I have set about writing this luminous leaf, that thou mayest know how dearly thou art cherished -- nor think that thou hast been forgotten -- in these sacred precincts; and that thou mayest not remain quiescent, but constantly tell forth the glad tidings, and be ever filled with fervour, and clamorous with expressions of joy. Upon thee be the Glory of God. Do thou convey my most wondrous Abhá greeting unto thine esteemed spouse, and the rest of thy dependents, male and female alike. 'Ayn 'Ayn

He is God

O beloved one! Do thou convey the expressions of my utmost love and kindness unto thy sister's children, to the degree that it may attract the hearts; and thereto strive that the light of faith may shine forth in their hearts. It is a pity that amongst thy kindred they should remain uninformed, and deprived of the grace of the All-Merciful. Care, association, kindness and love are all incumbent. 'Ayn 'Ayn

He is God

O ye survivors of two holy and blessed souls! Your letter was received. Its contents made clear and evident that through the protection and help of the Ancient Beauty ye remain, after the passing of his honour Sádiq, the august martyr's scion, firm and steadfast in the Cause of God. Ye are related to that servant of the Perspicuous Light, his honour Mishkín. That illustrious soul spent his whole life in humble, self-effacing, loving and sincere devotion to the Cause of God. He was the incarnation of spirit and the embodiment of light; and in outward perfections was distinguished from all his contemporaries. When he perfumed his nostrils with the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful, he became completely selfless and detached from all else but the True One, sacrificing his own rest and comfort in the path of God. He migrated from Írán to the territory of the Ottomans, and, having dwelt for a while in 'Iráq, hastened to Rumelia. From thence he travelled to the Great City of Istanbul, where he occupied himself with service. He became famed throughout all parts, and was bound in fetters for his love of God. Being subsequently banished from the Great City, he attained in Gallipoli the sacred presence of Bahá'u'lláh, and, accompanying Him on His journey thence, passed his time on board ship with the utmost joy and gladness. Upon our arrival in 'Akká, he was borne off to Cyprus, and confined in the citadel of Famagusta, where, under conditions of the utmost difficulty and hardship, he remained long captive. When the island came into the possession of the English government he was set free. At once he hastened to the Most Great Prison, and joined the companions of Bahá'u'lláh. Day and night he was occupied in transcribing and arranging the Sacred Tablets, and in producing calligraphic renderings of the Greatest Name. These pieces spread throughout all parts, so that in Írán and Túrán, Europe and America, Asia and Africa -- there is no city where some example of his penmanship is not to be found. Most of these pieces are of the Greatest Name. One of the Persian ministers in Paris even related the following: "Ere proceeding to Paris I made first a quick visit to Russia. In the city of Moscow, I was in a state of the utmost sorrow, pain and despair, until, upon entering the home of one of my friends, a highly respectable personage, my eye fell upon a tableau suspended in the upper part of the room, which had been executed with the utmost skill by his honour Mishkín. All at once I was overcome by a feeling of immense joy and happiness. To this day the memory of that joy and happiness abideth with me; nor shall I ever forget it." The person who related this was the minister Mu'ayyiru'l-Mamálik, the son-in-law of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh. He attained the blessing of belief and certitude, and whilst in Paris was occupied with various services. Ye are likewise related to that brilliant candle, his honour Sádiq. That blessed soul beheld his illustrious father, his honour the Beloved of Martyrs, a sacrificial victim on the altar of love. It is evident, therefore, what injuries he sustained. Yet he remained under all circumstances patient, and in all trials constant, until he took his flight unto the Abhá Kingdom, the infinite world. Ye are the relations of these two blessed and holy souls, and very dear in the sight of 'Abdu'l-Bahá. I therefore supplicate at the Blessed Threshold that, under the shadow of God's care and protection, ye may be shielded and preserved from all visitations and afflictions, and that ye may keep the shining lamp of those two illustrious souls ever luminous and refulgent. Do ye follow their example. Firdawsí in the Sháh-Námih saith of Kay-Khusraw:

This happy one doth of two kings signs bewray: * Of Afrásíyáb, likewise of Kávús-Kay

Upon you be the Glory of the Most Glorious. 'Ayn 'Ayn

*The Maidservant of God, Daughter of the martyr, the honoured Leaf Rúhá -- Húríyyih -- Farangís -- Aqdas -- 'Adhrá' -- Husayn Áqá -- Hasan Áqá*

He is God

O ye fruits of the tree of Supreme Sacrifice! That embodiment of spirit hastened unto the field of martyrdom, and that incarnation of light shone forth above the horizon of redemption. He cast upon that family such a ray as shall remain for ever shining and refulgent. Ye are the leaves of that tree and the fruits of that heavenly sadratu'l-muntahá. Do ye appreciate the value of this bounty, and recognize the sublimity of this honour. Strive ye to show forth the utmost freshness, delicacy and sweetness. Upon you by the Glory of the Most Glorious. 'Ayn 'Ayn

*Isfahán. The attracted Maidservant of God Rúhá, Daughter of the late Hájj Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, upon him by the Glory of God, the Most Glorious*

He is God

... O grandchild of the martyr in the path of God! The love which 'Abdu'l-Bahá beareth for the survivors of the martyrs is to the degree that the Concourse on high applaud it! These blessed souls laid down their lives. To use the popular expression, "It is no laughing matter." They tasted the venom of the sword, and made their mirror-like breasts the targets of a hundred thousand arrows. How easy it is to say! Now consider them, and consider those others who will not forego one iota of their lusts and passions. Slaves are they of their carnal appetites, and addicted to the pleasures and diversions of this dark and narrow world. Wherefore is there an immeasurable difference betwixt the twain. 'Abdu'l-Bahá cherisheth the wish of perfuming his nostrils with the fragrant dust of these luminous graves. This is my highest hope and my utmost aspiration. I beseech God to grant me this honour, and to enable me to follow their example. May my life be a sacrifice for them. May my heart be a sacrifice for them. I hope that, through the aid and preservation of the Lord of creation, thou wilt be shielded and preserved, and strengthened in thy services to His Holiness the Incomparable; and become a source of glory to the Cause of God. Do thou convey on my behalf kind remembrances and a fragrant greeting unto his honour Áqá Mírzá Husayn Áqá and Hasan Áqá, and unto his honour Mírzá Nusratu'lláh. A letter was written for the believing maidservant of God, Ághá Bíbí, which is enclosed. Do thou deliver it. Upon thee be the Glory of the Most Glorious. 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás, 21 Rabí'u'l-Avval 1340

He is the Most Glorious

O ye offshoots of the tree of Supreme Sacrifice! Notwithstanding that in these days a fresh affliction hath appeared, and a grievous calamity hath befallen -- the bird of holiness hath wearied of its abode in a strange land, and winged its flight unto its retreat in the Abhá Kingdom -- yet in these days, after the ascension of the Ancient Beauty, life is as death, and death is as life. Upon decease, every confident and steadfast believer, having been released from exile, will settle in his true home; and, having been delivered from estrangement, will join the circle of those who have been admitted into the Court of Grandeur. The atom will revert unto the Sun, and the dewdrop will draw sustenance from the Living Ocean. The thirsty one will find the fountain of life, and the sick one will enter the infirmary of the All-Knowing Physician. In fine, death for the deceased is the mightiest bestowal and the greatest mercy; whereas for the survivors it is the fire of grief and the anguish of separation. Since, however, this separation and deprivation are but for a season, while hereafter we shall all be brought together in the assembly of the world above, and in the Celestial Concourse in the Abhá Kingdom -- whereupon the consuming fire of this separation shall be forgot -- ye should take comfort, and, with patience and fortitude, be occupied with the reviving breezes of the meads of the Covenant, so that at each moment ye may find a fresh spirit and discover a new soul. The Glory of God be upon you. 'Ayn 'Ayn

O thou remnant of the martyrs! Grieve not: the compassionate Beloved is the Assuager of all griefs; that is, His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh. Sorrow not: thy heart and soul shall erelong be gladdened. Weep not; neither do thou lament: recite the Verse of the Most Great Glad Tidings, that thou mayest behold the joy of the world of Divine Unity, and perceive the bounty of the Majestic Lord. The ray of Divine favour hath so shone upon that house and family that its effulgence flasheth in the rising of the horizons of the dawn; while in the morning the gleaming trace of thine august sire extolleth the glory, the unity, the sanctity and the greatness of Him Who was the Author of this most great bounty. Take then a share from the ocean of his happiness, and obtain a portion from the bounty of his servitude. Why, despite such bounties, outpourings and bestowals, wouldst thou weep, wherefore lament? Yea, 'tis cause for untold joy and boundless happiness. 'Ayn 'Ayn

O thou survivor and memorial of that martyr beloved of the Lord of Grandeur! Whatsoever thou wishest, and whatsoever thou request or say -- all are acceptable in the Court of God. This servant accounteth the good pleasure of that family a means of attainment unto the good pleasure of the True One; for the Blessed Beauty held you in the kindliest regard. Therefore, whatsoever thy straitened heart wisheth, speak forth! Since, however, this matter is connected with the Law of God, this servant cannot breathe a word. For according to the binding injunction of the Book, ere entering upon one's fifteenth year marriage is not permitted. Nomination and betrothal too should not take place before the wedding: that is, after the engagement no more than 95 days should pass before the marriage. Likewise the consent of both parties is the first condition; yet consent before maturity is invalid, while the age of maturity is set at fifteen. Wherefore this servant cannot say aught, for it would contravene the express prescription of the Law of God. Otherwise, by the righteousness of God, I would not spare even mine own life. 'Ayn 'Ayn

O God, my God! I, verily, make plaint of my grief and sorrow by reason of the sorrows that have assailed me! Hast thou not heard the voice of the mourner, mourning thy distinguished servant, the scion of that august and majestic champion who, with beaming countenance, enkindled heart, and a spirit joyful at its impending ascent unto the kingdom of Thy sanctity, was martyred in Thy path, and his pure blood spilt upon the dust in Thy love? O my Lord! This scion, truly, followed the example of his august father in treading the Straight Path and the Undeviating Way; and passed his days with his eye gladdened by beholding Thy signs, his breast dilated through the breaths of Thy holiness, his tongue eloquent in commemoration of Thee, and his heart staunch in Thy love. O my Lord! He was touched by trials and tribulations, and bore every hardship and adversity, thanking Thee the while for each direst calamity, and each gravest affliction. O my Lord! Never throughout his life did he repose, nor spare any effort in serving Thy loved ones; until he heard the call from the Concourse on high: "O thou tranquil soul! Repair unto thy Lord, pleased and pleasing unto Him." Whereupon he responded to the call; departed this earthly home, and winged his flight unto the kingdom of eternity, the Divine home. O my Lord! Honour his last resting-place, and grant him an exalted seat of truth, transported by the wine of reunion in the Most Sublime Paradise, immersed in the oceans of lights in the Kingdom of Mysteries. Thou, verily, art the All-Pardoner, the Most Precious, the Ever-Forgiving. 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás, 22 Jím 2 year 1327

He is the Most Glorious

O thou holy and luminous leaf! Truly, in the path of God thou wast at all times the dawning-place of calamities and the focus of afflictions. Thou didst drink no draught of water in tranquillity, nor live a day without uttering a heart-consuming sigh. No night didst thou rest on the bed of comfort, nor for a moment didst thou taste the honey of tranquillity of heart and peacefulness of soul. Yet be not saddened, neither be thou sick at heart: for if placidity of heart, tranquillity of spirit, and bodily repose were truly important, praiseworthy and desirable, His Holiness the Prince of Martyrs would assuredly have sought and yearned after them; while all the Prophets and holy ones would have chosen them for themselves. Know therefore that calamities suffered in the path of the True One are bounties; and contentment under His decree is among the characteristics of the people of God. Do thou show the greatest consideration to the spouse of him that hath ascended unto God, and accord her greater honour than before. Likewise do thou educate the children with perfect joy and radiance. 'Ayn 'Ayn

From the Most Pure Pen of His Holiness, The Beloved Guardian of the Cause of God

O thou who hast plucked a brand from the fire of the love of God! Although outwardly communication and correspondence were for a while severed, yet the mystical ties and spiritual communications are at every moment present and unimpaired. That tireless servant of the Sacred Threshold is accounted among the well-favoured believers, and numbered with the steadfast and faithful maidservants of the Abhá Beauty. Thou shalt not pass from memory, nor in these sacred precincts be forgot. Wherefore with a gladsome heart and a tranquil spirit do thou pursue the path of service. He will assist thee, and grant thee victory and triumph. The servant of His Threshold, Shoghi

*For the attention of the Maidservant of God Rúhá Khánum-i-Maghzí, upon her be the Glory of God*

Honoured lady, thy letter arrived in the most luminous court, and was graced by the most holy glances of the beloved of mankind, his Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God -- may my soul be a sacrifice for his favours. The contents of the letter gave evidence of the Divine bounties and heavenly confirmations which -- praise be to God -- have surrounded thee on every hand. Whereof indeed there could be no greater, higher, more perfect or more glorious a proof than thy success in forming an assembly wherein thou hast brought together, in a forum of spiritual fellowship, a group of steadfast, well-grounded, enkindled maidservants of the All-Merciful, to whom thou art providing lessons in teaching the Cause. This outstanding service is in itself an incomparable bounty wherewith thou hast been blessed, honoured and distinguished. As the recipient, therefore, of so bountiful a favour, thou hast reason for the utmost happiness, joy and radiance. Do thou most certainly continue thine endeavours, and provide the means for perfecting and arranging this luminous gathering as is most requisite and fitting, so that it may become in all respects beloved, agreeable, acceptable and satisfactory. The pains and efforts of that honoured maidservant in this regard are undoubtedly favoured with approval and acceptance in the Court of the All-Knowing King. To all the maidservants of the Merciful who are members of the blessed assembly -- Sughrá Begum Núrí-Zádih, Bíbí Mishkín Fakhru'l-Mulúk-i-Mahbúbíyyih, Ruqíyyih Khánum-i-Bádkúbi'í, Mulkí-Ján-i-Ábádi'í, 'Adhrá' Khánum-i-Mahbúbíyyih, Munavvar Khánum, Ridváníyyih Khánum, Ádharmídukht-i-Maghzí, upon them be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious -- we express the most cordial felicitations; and our wish and hope at the Sacred Threshold on behalf of each one of them is for a yet greater measure of success and spiritual advancement. Know thou of a certainty that they are under the shadow of the glances of God's loving providence, and watched over by the eyes of the gracious favours of His Holiness the All-Merciful. Written by his blessed order. Núri'd-Dín Zayn, Rajab 1347, 21 December 1928

The Martyrdom of

His Honour Mullá Kázim-i-Tálkhúnchi'í

And the Apprehension of

His Honour Áqá Siyyid Áqá Ján, Upon Him Be the Glory of God

**
**

*Account of the Martyrdom of His Honour Mullá Kázim-i-Tálkhúnchi'í*

The village of Tálkhúnchih is one of the settlements in the environs of Isfahán. In those days no more than a handful of the friends of God resided there. One day, Mullá Kázim and Áqá Siyyid Áqá Ján, who were both servants of the Threshold of the Blessed Beauty, attended a gathering, which included also a number of Muslims. Mullá Kázim was engaged in smoking a narghile when all at once, without warning and for no apparent cause, one of the company, a religious bigot, raised the cry: "Ho, for shame! The pipe hath been defiled! This man is a Bahá'í!" Others too, emulating this ignorant man, raised a similar outcry. Siyyid Áqá Ján would fain have extinguished with the water of admonition and counsel the fire kindled in these rude souls; but they paid no heed to the admonitions of the loving counsellor, and, hurling themselves upon the two unfortunates, fiercely assailed them with wounding blows and insults. Not content with this, they then wrote an account of the incident to Shaykh Báqir the "Wolf," who in turn sent a message to Zillu's-Sultán instructing him to send several officials to bring the accused to Isfahán. The governor acted as bidden by the benighted cleric, and a band of ruffians proceeded to Tálkhúnchih; brought those two intimates of the Divine Court, with bared head and bare feet, on foot to Isfahán; and bore them into the presence of Shaykh Báqir. When the Shaykh's gaze fell upon the hapless pair he ordered them, after a deal of recrimination and expressions of ill-humour, to show through abuse and execration that they had renounced their faith, threatening them at the same time with death. But those two adorers of the True Beloved voiced abhorrence at the idea, exclaiming, "Would to God that we had one hundred thousand lives to lay down in His path!" At this, the flame of Shaykh Báqir's anger blazed up, and he sent word to Zillu's-Sultán to crucify them, and to adorn the gallows with their bodies. Zillu's-Sultán was at first hesitant to take their lives; but fearing as a result of Shaykh Báqir's reiterated threats for his leadership and position, he at length decided to put one of them to death. To this end he resolved that Mullá Kázim should die; while Siyyid Áqá Ján he excused from the sentence of death on account of his holy lineage. The Shaykh gave to outward seeming his consent to this proposal, and requested the governor to order his executioner to carry out the sentence. He then sent a crier abroad into the city to make a public proclamation; and, to the sound of drum and trumpet, he bore the wronged pair into the Maydán. That day was the twentieth of the month of Safar 1296 A.H. One of the followers of the Shaykh ventured to observe: "Today is the fortieth day after the martyrdom of the Prince of Martyrs, and shouldst thou defer this person's execution until the following day it would be preferable." The Shaykh replied however: "Precisely because it is the fortieth, the recompense merited by the action will be all the greater;" and delivered Mullá Kázim to the executioner. The latter at first ordered him to announce his repentance, and renunciation of the Cause; but his words had no effect, since Mullá Kázim remained as firm and steadfast as before in his love for the Abhá Beloved. Finally, the executioner severed the head of that great-souled hero from his body; and, that his victim might suffer the greater agony, so wielded his sword that it only slowly and gradually performed its task. Thereafter, at the Shaykh's bidding, the victim's body was suspended from the gallows. While this was in progress, however, the cord snapped. Pursuant to the Shaykh's orders, he was once more suspended from the gallows, but this time in such a manner that his neck and breast were hanging downwards, and his feet were raised aloft. The Shaykh announced: "Whoever casteth a stone at the one here suspended shall earn a mighty recompense." It is related that there was a lady who had been seized by the pangs of childbirth, yet still, in such a state, rose up and proceeded to the Maydán in order to cast a stone at that wronged one. Nor, whatever remonstrations were addressed to her, such as, "Thou art in labour, and like to bring upon thyself grievous hurt and calamity," would she be admonished, but went regardless to cast her stone at the martyr. That day, the children who chanced to meet each other boasted: "My mother went to cast a stone."

That pure body was still suspended at eventide when a group of people arrived and, kindling a fire, burnt his beard; cut off his lips, ears and nose; and gouged out his eyes from their sockets. Later too, at the Shaykh's behest, another company arrived and stoned him. Likewise on the second night others came and sundered him limb from limb. On the third day, the Shaykh came into the Maydán, and beheld that pure body thus dismembered and caked in dust and blood. Pursuant to the orders which he then immediately issued, a group of horsemen mounted their steeds, and galloped them over the noble temple of the martyr, pounding his sacred body beneath their horses' hooves. This done, they flung his remains into a well. As for Siyyid Áqá Ján, by Shaykh Báqir's order he was on the same day of his arrest bastinadoed and soundly beaten. Thereafter, again by the latter's order, his ears were cut off, and a halter was placed around his neck wherewith he was paraded about the city's thoroughfares and markets. Finally, he was cast into prison, where he tarried for a month. On the day when, at their behest, the Twin Shining Lights were martyred, the Shaykh and the Imám wished to have Siyyid Áqá Ján slain too. Learning, however, of this intention, Zillu's-Sultán summoned the latter before him; and, since he had from the outset vouchsafed him an assurance of safety, ordered that he should not bide in Isfahán, but leave the city. Accompanied by officials, Siyyid Áqá Ján accordingly departed from Isfahán. On his way he had the happy fortune to encounter their honours Nabíl-i-Qá'iní and Amín, to whom he recounted what had befallen him. Nabíl and Amín then set off for Qazvín, and related details of the story to the friends. After so much pain and hardship, Siyyid Áqá Ján became the object of God's loving favour; and in a Tablet Bahá'u'lláh indicates that although he was not martyred, he still has an estimable station in the eyes of God.

His honour Mírzá Ashraf-i-Ábádi'í, another of the martyrs of the Land of Sád, was slain at the behest of the son of the Wolf. His Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God -- exalted be his praise -- provides in the blessed tablet *God Passes By* a description of this event, whose purport in Persian is as follows:

In Isfahán Mírzá Ashraf was martyred, and his body trampled underfoot. This deed was the work of Shaykh Muhammad-Taqí, the son of the Wolf. His body was finally surrendered to the people, who, having fed with it the flames of a fire, deposited what remained of it in a place over which they destroyed a wall. *Finis*.

His honour Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alíy-i-Isfahání relates the following: "... The family of Áqá Mírzá Ashraf came originally from Bushrúyih. A Siyyid, he was born in Najaf-Ábád and educated in Isfahán. He was a divine and a scholar, and extremely sincere and devoted to the Cause. The Bahá'ís of Ábádih took him to Ábádih, where they provided him with a home and furnishings. Here he remained for well nigh thirty years, even becoming known as Mírzá Ashraf-i-Ábádi'í." *Finis*. The martyrdom of Mírzá Ashraf took place around the year 1307 A.H.

Others too hastened into the arena of martyrdom in Isfahán, both during the ministry of the Exalted Lord, and during those of the Ancient Beauty and the Centre of the Covenant. Ustád Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Salmání, who passed away in 'Ishqábád in 1324 A.H., records in his autobiography, which he wrote with his own pen, the names of a number of Bábís he himself had seen, who in some cases had been slaughtered, and in others apprehended and their ears nailed to a post ..." For information concerning the rest of the martyrs, reference may be had to the history of the Blessed Cause, and to the Tablets revealed in this regard. By way of example, I provide at this point an extract from the reminiscences of Lieutenant Ridá-Qulíy-i-Níkú-Bín concerning a number of the friends who suffered martyrdom and persecution.

At that period, when the soul-stirring call of the beloved Cause had produced a profound effect in all horizons and souls -- when in every town there was a stir and in every land a tumult -- the Muslims, acting at the prompting of their clergy, omitted no form of iniquity or oppression in their dealings with the generality of the Bahá'ís. *To cite an instance of this treatment:* In 1321 A.H. there occurred the disturbance named after the Russian consulate, a highly significant event which was of so grave a character that its flame overspread the face of Írán; but as a result of which the name of the Cause resonated more powerfully, and the cries of its impassioned lovers reached the ears of a greater number of those previously uninformed of it than ever before. Were I to relate the preliminaries of this disturbance, and to dwell upon the woes and vicissitudes the beloved friends suffered throughout its course, the account would become wearisome, and deflect me from my purpose. This much may be briefly stated that, in consequence of the successive afflictions and trials which they had long borne at the hands of the Muslims, the Bahá'ís had reached the point of desperation; and, on the advice of a number of leading figures of the age, including his honour Mírzá Hasan-i-Adíb (who had at that time newly arrived from Tihrán *en route* to Shíráz); Mírzá Asadu'lláh Khán-i-Vazír; Mírzá Muhammad Khán-i-Lashkar-Nivís, Mírzá Ahmad Khán-i-Fátihu'l-Mulk, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, son of the Beloved of Martyrs, and one or two officers of the Fawj-i-Jalálí, all, men and women alike, took refuge in the Russian consulate, seeking a decisive clarification of their status which, they hoped, might convey also an assurance of their freedom. Since the Consul was not himself present in Isfahán, his deputy submitted the matter -- both the representation of grievances and the appeal for justice -- to the royal court of Muzaffari'd-Dín Sháh, strongly urging that one of the two following courses be adopted: either that the Bahá'ís should be completely free, or that some other status should be determined for them. In order to achieve their object, the friends remained for more than twelve days in the aforesaid premises; yet for those few days, with what ineffable spirituality did the cry "Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!" fill the air of the place! How thrillingly did the soul-quickening recitations of Tablets and prayers cause the hearts to quiver! And how captivatingly did the children, though only of tender years, occupy themselves both day and night with singing heart-reviving melodies! For their maintenance, his excellency the Minister and his honour the Accountant (Lashkar-Nivís), girding up the loins of their endeavour, spared no expense in procuring necessary provisions. At length an undertaking was obtained from the Muslims to guarantee the safety of the Bahá'ís, which took the form of an oath, sworn on the glorious Qur'án, that they would no longer inflict harm on that community, but leave them to live their lives in peace. Once a modicum of assurance had been gained on this score, the Bahá'ís resolved to leave the consulate and to go about their normal business. No sooner had they emerged from the premises, however, than they were set upon by a mean rabble of the populace, and became embroiled in a violent fracas and upheaval. In the resulting turmoil, one Siyyid Abu'l-Qásim of Márnán near Isfahán was martyred, and his body lost without trace. Two other souls, Hájí Husayn and Hájí Hádí, both merchants of Isfahán, were martyred in the Maydán-i-Sháh, and their bodies set alight with oil. The remainder of the friends, having contrived by whatever exertions to deliver themselves from beneath the hands and feet of their assailants, in some cases made their way home, and in others quit the city. The effects of this general commotion and upheaval at once communicated themselves to the other cities of Írán, particularly to Yazd and some other parts, where an extraordinary tumult was engendered. *To cite another example:* On the night of a celebration and firework display which Zillu's-Sultán had arranged in the Bágh-i-Káj, and to which he had brought along also several members of our regimental band, he announced in a loud voice, which all present heard: "Know ye what night is this? It is the night whereon the God of the Bábís died!" Hearing this pronouncement on such a night -- coming as it did from the mouth of the outstanding personage in Írán at that epoch -- I fell to thinking, and in bemused wonderment asked myself: "What god is this who has died?" In fine, I was for long submerged in an ocean of bewilderment. *To cite yet another example:* There was in Isfahán a certain Mullá Sálih, who was a native of Tálkhúnchih, one of the dependencies of the city. He had a very famous and well-known school, which was patronized for the most part by nobles and dignitaries. He had too a general acquaintance with my father, and the latter accordingly entrusted my education to him. Hence, when my military exercises were complete, I would spend the rest of my time learning my lessons and applying myself to calligraphic exercises. So matters continued for a space. When the time arrived for the regiment to be dismissed, I repaired as usual to the country, and returned a while later to the city. One morning, as I was crossing the Maydán-i-Sháh on my way to the parade ground, I observed that a large crowd were forcibly dragging a poor wretch, whom they held captive in their midst, in the direction of the Masjid-i-Sháh, beating him the while with sticks, and belabouring him with blows and curses. Upon my approaching to inquire who it was, I was informed: "It is a Bábí: they want to take him to Áqá Najafí and obtain from him a death warrant so as to have him slain." Much affected by the spectacle, I drew closer, and all at once beheld that the subject of these proceedings was none other but the aforesaid Mullá Sálih. Despite myself, I exclaimed: "Áqá Mírzá, is it indeed thou?!" ("Áqá Mírzá" was in those days the appellation used for teachers.) Observing this reaction, the people glared at me as though they had a mind to inflict the like treatment upon me too; in view, however, of my military attire they had not courage to do so, but, turning their attention again to Mullá Sálih, continued beating the unfortunate man. He in the meantime fastened upon me imploring glances that seemed to bespeak an appeal for succour and redress; but of course what could one helpless child accomplish in the face of a hostile and powerful multitude? In view of the cordial attachment and deep-seated affection which I entertained for my teacher, my feelings all at once overcame me, and I involuntarily fell to weeping. Starting to cry aloud, I turned towards the crowd; but as it chanced, at that same moment an officer, a native of Tálkhúnchih who was acquainted with my father, appeared upon the scene. Running at once towards him, I pleaded: "This person is our teacher: don't let them beat him! They want to kill him!" The officer replied: "Knowest thou not forsooth that this is a Bábí? Let them beat him! Should they wish to kill him, what is it to thee that he was once thy teacher? Go and attend to thine own affairs!" Seeing, however, that his admonitions produced no effect on me, he carried me off from thence; and, once away from the crowd, I betook me to my father, and explained to him exactly what had taken place. No sooner was my father informed how matters stood than he exclaimed indignantly: "So then, Sergeant 'Alí (the name of the aforesaid officer) hath revealed his malice against poor Mullá Sálih!" With this, he arose from his place, and left the room to see about effecting the Mullá's deliverance. An hour later he brought back the Mullá, bare-headed and bare-footed as before, and that night conveyed him surreptitiously out of the city. In fine, after a certain period, when the business had lost its novelty, the Mullá came again into the city, and resumed his former occupation.

Section Eight

The Fate of Those Who Caused

The Martyrdom of

The Twin Shining Lights

It was not long after the passing of the Twin Shining Lights that the implacable persecutors and instigators of the martyrdom of those two wronged ones were each afflicted with the most grievous torment, and overtaken by the avenging wrath of God. One was banished and expelled from Isfahán, ending his days in the utmost humiliation and abasement, while the other was visited with a fatal wound and virulent sickness which caused all his relatives, his wife and children, to shrink from him in disgust and loathing. Zillu's-Sultán incurred the ire of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh; the extent of his government, which had included most of the territories of Írán, was restricted to Isfahán; and eventually he left Írán for foreign parts, remaining long bewildered and unsettled. Returning later to Írán, he was afflicted with a condition of acute insanity, which robbed him entirely of the use of his wits and reason, to the degree that he even consumed his own bodily excretions; and finally, in the utmost wretchedness, he yielded up his life. His body was transported to Mashhad in Khurásán, where it was laid to rest. On the way thither a hungry dog managed to intrude itself into his coffin by night, and ate a quantity of his flesh and bone, thereby fulfilling the purport of a blessed utterance of 'Abdu'l-Bahá in his respect: "O God! Do Thou set over him a dog, that it may gnaw all his bones!" Contemporary historians such as Muhammad-Hasan Khán, Saní'u'd-Dawlih (the son of Hájí 'Alí Khán, Hájibu'd-Dawliy-i-Marághi'í) and others have in their works paid various tributes to him, and made him the object of their praise. For example, in the fifth volume of his *Mir'átu'l-Buldán-i-Násirí*, Saní'u'd-Dawlih has drawn the likeness of Zillu's-Sultán, and described the grandeur of his station; and even though Zillu's-Sultán had a squint, and looked askance, he has represented him in the depiction as whole and sound, nor at all stinted himself in servile blandishments. In the Holy Tablets he has been referred to as the "Fading Shadow." In this connection, I shall cite here what I have written in the second volume of the work *Rahíq-i-Makhtúm*.

"Fading Shadow"

Intended by the expression is Prince Mas'úd Mírzá, Zillu's-Sultán, the son of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh, who occasioned in Isfahán the martyrdoms of the Twin Shining Lights; of Mírzá Ashraf-i-Najaf-Ábádí, resident in Ábádih; and of Mullá Kázim-i-Tálkhúnchi'í; and who strenuously opposed the Blessed Cause. In a Tablet to Mír Muhammad-Husayn Big-i-Bushrúyi'í, the Blessed Beauty explains the reason for his opposition to the Faith of God as follows.

*His exalted Utterance:*

It is a matter of astonishment that until now the Sháh of Persia hath not adverted to the loving-kindness, the patience and the clemency extended to him from on high. Do thou beseech the One True God to make the Sháh aware. His real enemy is his son, Zillu's-Sultán. All know that he despatched Sayyáh unto the Most Great Prison especially to set afoot a great sedition; the which being denied him, he rose up in opposition to the Cause. The Sháh too credited his fantasies and fabrications, and surrendered the cities and regions of God unto the most ravening wolf on the surface of the earth. In the whole world there hath not been, nor is there, his like or equal for villainy and malice. Some while previously We spake this most exalted Word: "Of the blood of God's loved ones he, verily, hath quaffed what neither the Tigris, nor the Euphrates, nor the Jayhún, nor the Sayhún, can equal ..."

(Date of the Tablet: 9 Jím 1, year 1309 A.H.)

His Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God writes in the Centennial Tablet to the American friends words to this effect:

"...The tyrannical and cruel prince Mas'úd Mírzá, Zillu's-Sultán, the eldest son of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh, who held sway over two fifths of his father's dominions, and was stigmatised by the pen of His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh as the "Infernal Tree," was in the end overtaken by ill-fortune and disaster. The extent of his dominions was limited to Isfahán, and he was stripped and deprived of all his former respect, honour, rank and glory. Jalálu'd-Dawlih, who was branded by the Supreme Pen as "The Oppressor of the Land of Yá'," was, a year after the bloodshed and mischief he had committed, deposed and summoned to Tihrán, where he was forced to return a part of the property he had stolen from his oppressed victims. (The Centennial Tablet of America, p. 232)

A portion of the blessed utterances of 'Abdu'l-Bahá touching Zillu's-Sultán will be presented at this juncture.

*His most sweet utterance:*

"... In Switzerland, we were making our way towards the hotel, which was built atop a mountain, when all at once I noticed that a strange figure wearing a Western-style hat had fallen in with our company, and was walking close beside me. When I looked at him, he came forward, made obeisance, and said: "Pray sir, art thou not 'Abbás Effendi?" "I cannot deny it!" I replied. "I have been greatly desirous of meeting thee," he continued, "I shall come again. Be sure that I shall come again." With this, he took his leave of me and went his way. Thereafter we met on numerous occasions. In Paris, he stayed at a hotel at a cost of fifteen French guineas a day. The hotel staff also received from him fifteen guineas. To bid him welcome, they called him "Prince," which gratified him. He invited us to a meal in that hotel, and put on a very splendid affair -- it was a regular banquet. He sought repeatedly to distance himself from the death of the King of Martyrs, and to represent himself as blameless in the matter. When a suitable moment presented itself, I said: "Very good, thou wast not responsible for the death of the martyrs: would it not have been well to restore their property?" -- to which he gave absolutely no reply. His all-consuming wish was that I should reveal to him his future, for he was intent on wielding a controlling influence in Írán. Although he did not use the word "kingship," he wished to be the most influential figure in Írán. Finally one day he put the matter into words, and said: "I wish to hear my future from thy tongue: what doth it hold in store?" I told him: "We are no soothsayer: none but God hath knowledge of the unseen. An intelligent person may, however, make certain deductions. What I know is this, that thou must put all vain imaginings out of thy head. The things thou wishest for shall never be; but I guarantee that thy wealth shall be preserved: safe from any danger, this wealth shall remain for thee and for thine expenses. I told him plainly: "The other things shall never come about, but thy wealth is safe, rest assured thereof." To a degree he *was* assured, although inwardly he still wished for influence and power. One day I went for a walk in the Bois de Boulogne. All at once I saw that Zillu's-Sultán had arrived and was alighting from a carriage. He had also a woman in his company. Then, as he made his way over to me, and fell into conversation, the son of Nizámu'l-'Ulamá'-i-Tabrízí appeared, and likewise made obeisance. Zillu's-Sultán began extolling him, saying, "This gentleman is the son of the Nizámu'l-'Ulamá'. What good friends this family have been to the Qájár family! What services they have rendered! And withal how favourably have they ever been regarded by the Qájárs!" He continued protractedly in this vein until we wearied of it. At length, the son of the Nizámu'l-'Ulamá' took his leave and departed. No sooner had he gone than Zillu's-Sultán exclaimed, "Áqá! Dost thou mark this fellow? -- a rascally knave, whose like the world hath not seen!" and he set to reviling him. He said: "Now will he go and tell his comrades that Zillu's-Sultán was e'en now in the company of the Áqá!" Ismá'íl Mírzá and Akbar Mírzá (the sons of Zillu's-Sultán), and Jalálu'd-Dawlih also came to me. Jalálu'd-Dawlih showed forth great lowliness, and several times came to express repentance for his deeds ..."

(Blessed talk in Haifa, 2 -- year 1916)

Zillu's-Sultán was exceedingly ruthless, and did not shrink from any kind of action or proceeding, no matter how ugly and repellent. It is related that he had two very large and rapacious hounds, which he fed and cared for with his own hand. One day, in search of sport, he took them with him out of the city. On the way, a wretched cultivator presented to him a letter complaining of the injustice and cruelty of the headman of his village. Zillu's-Sultán, who was on horseback, took the letter, and, having glanced at it, made of a sudden a sign to the two rapacious hounds; whereat the bloodthirsty creatures flew with mortal intent upon that poor defenceless cultivator, and tore his body to shreds. The Qájár prince, august scion of the "victorious" monarch Násiri'd-Dín Sháh -- he who is considered the embodiment of "fateful power," of "mighty splendour" and of "heavenly elevation" -- gazed at this fearsome spectacle, and from the very excess of delight and pleasure it afforded him emitted loud guffaws of laughter. By the testimony of history, the world has seen many people of this kind who derived pleasure from the pain and suffering of the victims of oppression. The names of Queen Catherine of Imperial Russia, Hajjáj Ibn-i-Yúsuf-i-Thaqafí, Tamerlane, and the like are recorded and preserved in the history books as examples of the type; yet the cruelties of Zillu's-Sultán were more numerous and grievous than those wrought by any of these. It is related that when, after the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights, the prince and Shaykh Báqir fell out over the distribution of their property, Shaykh Báqir set out for Najaf, and, for fear of the prince, forsook Isfahán. During his father's reign, Zillu's-Sultán attempted to do away with him, and to succeed him on the throne of Írán. In this hope, he despatched his special companion Hájí Sayyáh to 'Akká with a message for Bahá'u'lláh, promising that if He would order the Bahá'ís to support him, and if he were in consequence to win the crown, he would grant the Bahá'ís official recognition, and do this and that besides. Hájí Sayyáh arrived in His blessed presence, and delivered the message of Zillu's-Sultán; to which the Blessed Beauty replied: "We have no involvement in political affairs: Our gaze is fixed upon the hearts of men, not upon the governance of lands." When Hájí Sayyáh, whom Bahá'u'lláh has referred to in a Blessed Tablet as "ignorant," relayed this response to Zillu's-Sultán, the prince was wroth, and rose up in opposition to the Cause of God. Amongst other measures, he authorized the martyrdoms of their honours Mullá Kázim-i-Tálkhúnchi'í, and of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, and inflicted much harm on the friends. The Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- has set forth these matters in detail in a Blessed Tablet, and referred to Zillu's-Sultán as a "Fading Shadow." Zillu's-Sultán was finally disappointed in his hopes of sovereignty, and incurred the wrath and anger of his father, who removed extensive territories from his control, so that had perforce to content himself with the governorship of Isfahán.

"Fate of the She-Serpent"

Intended by the expression is Mír Siyyid Husayn, the Imám-Jum'ih of Isfahán, who, with the aid of Shaykh Báqir-i-Isfahání, brought about the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights. In the Tablet of the Proof the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- has styled the Imám-Jum'ih the "She-Serpent," and Shaykh Báqir the "Wolf." An account of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights is provided under the heading "Bloodthirsty." The Wolf and the She-Serpent both suffered the evil consequences of their actions, as has been mentioned in the Divine Tablets; amongst them one in which Bahá'u'lláh says.

*His exalted Utterance:*

Observe thou how in the Land of Sád that malignant monster who was the cause and instigator of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights was overtaken by the direst torment, to the degree that all the members of his household shunned him. *Finis*.

Likewise in another Tablet He has described how Divine chastisement and displeasure descended upon the She-Serpent and the Wolf.

*His Precious Words:*

O Habíb! Rejoice thou, inasmuch as He Who is the Ever-Forgiving hath forgiven thee, and purified thee from all sins. Thy Lord is of a truth the Gracious. He hath visited upon the She-Serpent an afflictive outpouring of his wrath, and left him under the scourges of his own iniquitous and loathsome deed. He, verily, was the foundation of the evil and the root thereof. Ere the requital of the hereafter We subjected him to a recompense here below such that the denizens of the Fire sought refuge therefrom with God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The blasts of chastisement assailed him from all sides: this was ere the departure of his spirit; thereafter the avenging angels drove him to the lowest depths of Hell. (*Until He saith, blessed and exalted be He*) We visited the Wolf with an agony inconceivable to all but God, the Lord of the worlds; and this was in the first year after he opposed My Name Há'. Thy Lord, verily, is the Stern Avenger. By My life! No medicine shall heal him, nor aught that is in the kingdom of creation cure him. His anguish shall but grow, not lessen, until he returneth unto his abode: then shall he behold what no description, nor the most discerning reckoner, can depict. Before him We laid hold upon the Chief, through the power of Our might, even as in bygone centuries We have laid hold upon others yet greater than he, and I am the Elucidator, the All-Informed."

There are many Tablets from the Blessed Beauty describing how Divine displeasure descended upon the She-Serpent and the Wolf. In his book *Bihjatu's-Sudúr*, the late Hájí says touching the slayers of the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs.

*His words, peace be upon him:*

After the martyrdom of his honour the King of Martyrs -- may my life be a sacrifice for the drops of his and his brother's blood -- which was on account of the property and wealth of those two martyrs in the path of God, the Imám-Jum'ih, having been rendered blind and dumb as a judgment upon him for his wrongful action, fell out with his excellency Zillu's-Sultán, and stirred up the people against the government. It was on the fortieth day after the death of these two wronged martyrs that his excellency sent the Imám-Jum'ih, by constraint and as a captive, out of Isfahán, so fulfilling the purport of the stern admonition sent down to him from the pen of the One in Whose grasp are the reins of all affairs: "Ere long will the breaths of chastisement seize thee from all sides, even as they seized others before thee. Wait thou ...." *Finis*.

His holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God includes in his Centennial Tablet to the American friends a passage to this effect: "Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir, whom His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh has named in the Tablet of the Proof the 'Wolf,' and to whom He has also addressed the rebuke 'Thou art even as the last trace of sunlight upon the mountain-top,' yielded up his life in the utmost wretchedness, misery, regret and remorse. Mír Muhammad-Husayn, styled the 'She-Serpent,' whom the Ancient Beauty has called more merciless and wicked than the oppressor of the Land of Taff, was in those same days banished and exiled from Isfahán; wandered from village to village in search of refuge; and was suddenly afflicted by a malady which caused his body to emit a putrid odour, whose rankness was such that even his wife and daughter would not approach him. In this woeful state he passed away; and since none of the inhabitants of the place dared to bury him, he was finally interred by a few porters." pp. 232 -- 233. *Finis*.

The grave of Mír Muhammad-Husayn the "She-Serpent," the brother of Siyyid Muhammad, the Sultánu'l-'Ulamá', the Imám-Jum'ih, is in a part of Isfahán called "Sar-Qabr Áqá." The year of the Sultánu'l-'Ulamá's death has been given as 1291 A.H. Mír Muhammad-Husayn was the brother of the Imám-Jum'ih, and succeeded him in that post. He passed away as the result of a strange illness in a state of the utmost abasement. It has not been possible to obtain the year of his death, for in the notices of graves and shrines no mention has been made of his grave. When, in order to investigate the matter, recourse was had to his resting-place in the Sar-Qabr Áqá cemetery, no stone was found upon his grave. The allusion in the name "Sar-Qabr Áqá" is to Mír Siyyid Muhammad, the great Imám-Jum'ih, whose grave is situated there -- that is, in a desert place which now goes by his name. After the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights, Zillu's-Sultán and the Imám-Jum'ih fell out over the distribution of the property. On several occasions the prince invited the Imám-Jum'ih to a special hunting-ground known as Qámishlú, and, before a host of people who were assembled there with him, and in the presence of the Imám-Jum'ih himself, prompted his personal jester, Mírzá Hasan-i-Santúrí, to make fun of the Imám by mimicking his form and appearance. Finally, a prodigious sore appeared on the Imám's neck, which some say was a cancer; and it was not long thereafter that he ended his earthly existence. In a Tablet revealed from the pen of the Blessed Beauty, and which was included in the preceding, it is clearly stated that the suffering and travail of the She-Serpent began in that same first year after the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights; while it is commonly accepted that his death occurred in the second year after the martyrs' death: that is, in the year 1298 A.H.

*Facsimile of a Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Bahá to Khánum Díyá', the daughter of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq from his first wife, Sakínih Begum. The text of the Tablet is as follows: "The well-assured Leaf, the Maidservant of God Khánum Díyá', upon her be the Glory of God // He is God // O thou wronged one in the path of Bahá! I read what thou didst write, and grieved for thy sorrowful state. But one should offer thanks that all these afflictions befell in the path of God, and that in affliction thou art the heir of two martyrs and the memorial of two precious souls in the Court of the Majestic Lord. Wherefore be not sad, be not despondent. Thou art of the house of Truth, and a member of the family; thou art at home, and an intimate in the eyes of all the household. Beware lest thou be downcast, or utter sighs and moans. This separation will pass, and -- God willing -- thou shalt enter the circle of those favoured in the Court of God. Be assured thereof. The everlasting world is thine. 'Ayn 'Ayn // Do thou deliver to the beloved of 'Abdu'l-Bahá Áqá Mírzá 'Ináyatu'lláh a loving greeting, and also to the maidservant of God his mother. 'Ayn 'Ayn"*

The Blessed Tablet known as the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf was revealed from the pen of the Ancient Beauty -- exalted be His glory -- for the aforementioned Áqá Najafí, and was delivered to him in an indirect manner by one of the friends of God. It is commonly believed that the original of the Tablet is in the possession of his children. His children and grandchildren live today in Isfahán, where they hold many estates, lands and properties: as the poet said: "He bore the infamy, others the gold." The iniquities and improper behaviour of this man are also a cause of astonishment to people of discernment. There is no doubt that Áqá Najafí was in the habit of consuming alcoholic beverages several times a day. Ardishír Hizárí, who is one of the staunch and steadfast friends, and among the sterling, noble and detached believers of Pársí origin, related to the writer the following: "During the period when Áqá Najafí held sway in the city, I was engaged in Isfahán as an apprentice in the commercial chamber of Arbáb Jamshíd, the well-known Pársí merchant. One day my master instructed me to go to Áqá Najafí, and deliver to him a message by word of mouth. I duly went to him, delivered the message, and received his reply. As I was leaving he called me back, and whispered softly in my ear: 'Tell Arbáb Jamshíd: Áqá Najafí saith that his supply of drink is finished, and that as soon as possible he should procure a replenishment, and despatch it hither.' When I conveyed this message to Arbáb Jamshíd he was annoyed, and indignantly exclaimed, 'Gracious God! How much drink must this fellow consume for it to have gone so quickly! I sent him a crate not three days since, and here he is again saying "My drink is finished"!' With this, my master sent off to Áqá Najafí another crate of drink." In fine, people's property, lives and reputations were entirely in the hands of this man. Yet in nooks and corners there were perspicacious and discerning people who reprehended his deeds and actions, and contrived by diverse means to make him the object of their barbs. It is related that Karím-i-Shírakí, the well-known jester of the Sháh, stayed for a while in Isfahán. Whenever Áqá Najafí went abroad on his ass, people would rush upon him from all sides so as to kiss his hand, and pandemonium would ensue. Some of those who could not reach the prelate would even kiss the hooves and tail of his ass. One day, when Áqá Najafí was mounted on his ass, and the people were as usual rushing upon him in order to kiss his hand, Karím-i-Shírakí drew nigh to the prelate, and, having thrown his arm around the ass's neck, began kissing its head and ears, exclaiming in a loud voice, 'O Áqá! O our refuge! O our pontiff! O Áqá! May I be a sacrifice for thine ass's head!' Áqá Najafí took the meaning of the jibe, but did not betray it upon his countenance. Siyyid Sadru'd-Dín-i-Dirakhshán, who is a learned and knowledgeable Bahá'í of Isfahán, and a member of the Sacred Spiritual Assembly of that city, related to the author on the authority of his illustrious father, the late Hujjatu'l-Islám Áqá Siyyid Javád -- peace be upon him -- that during the period when Áqá Najafí held sway in the city, one of its liberal-minded divines, who was a shrewd observer, feigned madness so that he might express freely whatsoever was in his heart. The name of this man, who was a true Muslim, and averse to the hypocritical displays of the likes of Áqá Najafí, was Áqá Siyyid Hasan. For the most part, he would collect loose leaves of the Qur'án, and miscellaneous papers, and dispose them about himself, inventing for each of them some suitable tale, which he then used as a pretext to reveal his true intentions. It was Áqá Najafí's practice to go each day to the Masjid-i-Sháh in order to give instruction to the students of religious sciences. One day, the aforesaid late Áqá Siyyid Hasan, who was known as Áqáy-i-Masjid-Hakímí, was seated before the entrance of the Masjid-i-Sháh and humming to himself, whilst holding in his hands some pages of the Qur'án. As he was thus engaged, Áqá Najafí appeared in the distance, affording, since a crowd of religious scholars and disciples were following in his rear, a living representation of the Verse "... who, when he heareth the tread of sandals following behind him, waxeth greater in his own esteem than Nimrod." When, upon arriving at the entrance of the mosque, his eyes fell on Áqá Siyyid Hasan-i-Masjid-Hakímí, Áqá Najafí, who was carrying beneath his arm a quantity of books, asked: "Áqá Siyyid Hasan, what dost thou here?" The Siyyid, summoning a smile to his lips, replied: "Áqá! I was reading the Qur'án, and thinking that these Divine Verses must surely have some external object in the world to which they particularly apply. Now the answer to this question hath become clear to me, for the particular object of this Verse, which I was but now reading, hath been palpably realized before my eyes." Áqá Najafí asked, "Which is the Verse whose object hath been made apparent?" Holding the page of the Qur'án before his eyes, Áqá Siyyid Hasan read out: "Those who were charged with the Torah, then bore it not, are like unto an ass laden with books." "Áqá," he continued, "When I saw thee coming with these books beneath thine arm, I beheld the object of this Verse plainly revealed before me." Áqá Najafí preserved his silence and went his way. He also related that one cold winter's day, when Áqá Najafí was performing his ablutions using water from the pool of the Masjid-i-Sháh, which had completely frozen over, Áqá Siyyid Hasan-i-Masjid-Hakímí came up and said: "Áqá! It is bitterly cold!" Áqá Najafí replied: "It is indeed, but in the path of God what issue can be taken with such hardships?" Áqá Siyyid Hasan replied, "If the water of this pool were heated, it would be a boon to those of us who are poor." "How might the water of this pond be heated?" Áqá Najafí inquired. Áqá Siyyid Hasan replied, "Áqá, that might very easily be accomplished." "How?" asked Áqá Najafí. Áqá Siyyid Husayn replied "I know how it can be done." "How?" Áqá Najafí persisted. "Áqá!" the latter replied, "Do thou bid the believers go and break open the grave of thy late father, bring him hither and inter him near this pool. The heat of his grave will then instantly cause the water to boil." The believers laughed, while Áqá Najafí preserved his silence. Many stories of this kind have been related of him.

After the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights, the Blessed Tablet of the Proof, addressed to both the Wolf and the She-Serpent, issued from the pen of His Holiness the Most Compassionate, and it is in this work that He bestowed upon them these titles. I provide the text of that Tablet as the next item in this notebook. Another Tablet, bearing the name of the son of the Wolf, issued from the pen of the Blessed Beauty for Áqá Najafí, and was conveyed to him by the friends of Isfahán. That Tablet, which is very extensive, has since been printed and published, and is available to the friends.

*The Blessed Tablet of the Proof*

*Revealed from the Pen of the Ancient Beauty*

*Glorified be His Most Great Name*

He is the Almighty, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise

The winds of hatred have encompassed the Ark of Bathá (Mecca), by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. O Báqir! Thou hast pronounced sentence against them for whom the books of the world have wept, and in whose favour the scriptures of all religions have testified. Thou, who art gone far astray, art indeed wrapt in a thick veil. By God Himself! Thou hast pronounced judgement against them through whom the horizon of faith hath been illumined. Unto this bear witness They Who are the Dawning-Places of Revelation and the Manifestations of the Cause of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, Who have sacrificed Their souls and all that They possessed in His Straight Path. The Faith of God hath cried everywhere, by reason of thy tyranny, and yet thou disportest thyself and art of them that exult. There is no hatred in Mine heart for thee nor for anyone. Every man of learning beholdeth thee, and such as are like thee, engulfed in evident folly. Hadst thou realized that which thou hast done, thou wouldst have cast thyself into the fire, or abandoned thine home and fled into the mountains, or wouldst have groaned until thou hadst returned unto the place destined for thee by Him Who is the Lord of strength and of might. O thou who art even as nothing! Rend thou asunder the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings, that thou mayest behold the Day-Star of knowledge shining from this resplendent Horizon. Thou hast torn in pieces a remnant of the Prophet Himself, and imagined that thou hadst helped the Faith of God. Thus hath thy soul prompted thee, and thou art truly one of the heedless. Thine act hath consumed the hearts of the Concourse on high, and those of such as have circled round the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. The soul of the Chaste One (Fátimih) melted, by reason of thy cruelty, and the inmates of Paradise wept sore in that blessed Spot. // Judge thou fairly, I adjure thee by God. What proof did the Jewish doctors adduce wherewith to condemn Him Who was the Spirit of God (Jesus) when He came unto them with truth? What could have been the evidence produced by the Pharisees and the idolatrous priests to justify their denial of Muhammad, the Apostle of God when He came unto them with a Book that judged between truth and falsehood with a justice which turned into light the darkness of the earth, and enraptured the hearts of such as had known Him? Indeed thou hast produced, in this day, the same proofs which the foolish divines advanced in that age. Unto this testifieth He Who is the King of the realm of grace in this great Prison. Thou hast, truly, walked in their ways, nay, hast surpassed them in their cruelty, and hast deemed thyself to be helping the Faith and defending the Law of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By Him Who is the Truth! Thine iniquity hath made Gabriel to groan, and hath drawn tears from the Law of God, through which the breezes of justice have been wafted over all who are in heaven and on earth. Hast thou fondly imagined that the judgement thou didst pronounce hath profited thee? Nay, by Him Who is the King of all Names! Unto thy loss testifieth He with Whom is the knowledge of all things as recorded in the Preserved Tablet. When thou didst pen thy judgement, thou wast accused by thy very pen. Unto this doth bear witness the Pen of God, the Most High, in His inaccessible station. // O thou who hast gone astray! Thou hast neither seen Me, nor associated with Me, nor been My companion for the fraction of a moment. How is it, then, that thou hast bidden men to curse Me? Didst thou, in this, follow the promptings of thine own desires, or didst thou obey thy Lord? Produce thou a sign, if thou art one of the truthful. We testify that thou hast cast behind thy back the Law of God, and laid hold on the dictates of thy passions. Nothing, in truth, escapeth His knowledge; He, verily, is the Incomparable, the All-Informed. O heedless one! Hearken unto that which the Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'án: "Say not to every one who meeteth you with a greeting, 'Thou art not a believer.'" Thus hath He decreed in Whose grasp are the kingdoms of Revelation and of creation, if thou be of them that hearken. Thou hast set aside the commandment of God, and clung unto the promptings of thine own desire. Woe, then, unto thee, O careless one that doubtest! If thou deniest Me, by what proof canst thou vindicate the truth of that which thou dost possess? Produce it, then, O thou who hast joined partners with God, and turned aside from His sovereignty that hath encompassed the worlds! // O foolish one! Know thou that he is truly learned who hath acknowledged My Revelation, and drunk from the Ocean of My knowledge, and soared in the atmosphere of My love, and cast away all else besides Me, and taken firm hold on that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of My wondrous utterance. He, verily, is even as an eye unto mankind, and as the spirit of life unto the body of all creation. Glorified be the All-Merciful Who hath enlightened him, and caused him to arise and serve His great and mighty Cause. Verily, such a man is blessed by the Concourse on high, and by them who dwell within the Tabernacle of Grandeur, who have quaffed My sealed Wine in My Name, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. O Báqir! If thou be of them that occupy such a sublime station, produce then a sign from God, the Creator of the heavens. And shouldst thou recognize thy powerlessness, do thou rein in thy passions, and return unto thy Lord, that perchance He may forgive thee thy sins which have caused the leaves of the Divine Lote Tree to be burnt up, and the Rock to cry out, and the eyes of men of understanding to weep. Because of thee the Veil of Divinity was rent asunder, and the Ark foundered, and the She-Camel was hamstrung, and the Spirit (Jesus) groaned in His sublime retreat. Disputest thou with Him Who hath come unto thee with the testimonies of God and His signs which thou possessest and which are in the possession of them that dwell on earth? Open thine eyes that thou mayest behold this Wronged One shining forth above the horizon of the Will of God, the Sovereign, the Truth, the Resplendent. Unstop, then, the ear of thine heart that thou mayest hearken unto the speech of the Divine Lote Tree that hath been raised up in truth by God, the Almighty, the Beneficent. Verily, this Tree, notwithstanding the things that befell it by reason of thy cruelty and of the transgressions of such as are like thee, calleth aloud and summoneth all men unto the Sadratu'l-Muntahá and the Supreme Horizon. Blessed is the soul that hath gazed on the Most Mighty Sign, and the ear that hath heard His most sweet Voice, and woe to whosoever hath turned aside and done wickedly. // O thou who hast turned away from God! Wert thou to look with the eye of fairness upon the Divine Lote Tree, thou wouldst perceive the marks of thy sword on its boughs, and its branches, and its leaves, notwithstanding that God created thee for the purpose of recognizing and of serving it. Reflect, that haply thou mayest recognize thine iniquity and be numbered with such as have repented. Thinkest thou that We fear thy cruelty? Know thou and be well assured that from the first day whereon the voice of the Most Sublime Pen was raised betwixt earth and heaven We offered up Our souls, and Our bodies, and Our sons, and Our possessions in the path of God, the Exalted, the Great, and We glory therein amongst all created things and the Concourse on high. Unto this testify the things which have befallen Us in this Straight Path. By God! Our hearts were consumed, and Our bodies were crucified, and Our blood was spilt, while Our eyes were fixed on the horizon of the loving-kindness of their Lord, the Witness, the All-Seeing. The more grievous their woes, the greater waxed the love of the people of Bahá. Unto their sincerity hath borne witness what the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Qur'án. He saith: "Wish ye, then, for death, if ye are sincere." Who is to be preferred, he that hath sheltered himself behind curtains, or he that hath offered himself in the path of God? Judge thou fairly, and be not of them that rove distraught in the wilderness of falsehood. So carried away have they been by the living waters of the love of the Most Merciful, that neither the arms of the world nor the swords of the nations have deterred them from setting their faces towards the ocean of the bounty of their Lord, the Giver, the Generous. // By God! Troubles have failed to unnerve Me, and the repudiation of the divines hath been powerless to weaken Me. I have spoken, and still speak forth before the face of men: "The door of grace hath been unlocked and He Who is the Dayspring of Justice is come with perspicuous signs and evident testimonies, from God, the Lord of strength and of might!" Present thyself before Me that thou mayest hear the mysteries which were heard by the Son of 'Imrán (Moses) upon the Sinai of Wisdom. Thus commandeth thee He Who is the Dawning-Place of the Revelation of thy Lord, the God of Mercy, from His great Prison. // Hath leadership made thee proud? Peruse thou what God hath revealed to the Sovereign ruler, the Sultán of Turkey, who hath incarcerated Me in this fortified stronghold, so that thou mayest be informed of the condition of this Wronged One, as decreed by God, the One, the Single, the All-Informed. Art thou happy to see the abject and worthless as thy followers? They support thee as did a people before them, they that followed Annas, who, without clear proof and testimony, pronounced judgement against the Spirit. // Peruse thou the Kitáb-i-Íqán and that which the All-Merciful hath sent down unto the King of Paris and to such as are like him, that thou mayest be made aware of the things that have happened in the past, and be persuaded that We have not sought to spread disorder in the land after it had been well-ordered. We exhort, wholly for the sake of God, His servants. Let him who wisheth turn unto Him, and him who wisheth turn aside. Our Lord, the Merciful, is verily the All-Sufficing, the All-Praised. O concourse of divines! This is the day whereon nothing amongst all things, nor any name amongst all names, can profit you save through this Name which God hath made the Manifestation of His Cause and the Dayspring of His Most Excellent Titles unto all who are in the kingdom of creation. Blessed is that man that hath recognized the fragrance of the All-Merciful and been numbered with the steadfast. Your sciences shall not profit you in this day, nor your arts, nor your treasures, nor your glory. Cast them all behind your backs, and set your faces towards the Most Sublime Word through which the Scriptures and the Books and this lucid Tablet have been distinctly set forth. Cast away, O concourse of divines, the things ye have composed with the pens of your idle fancies and vain imaginings. By God! The Day-Star of Knowledge hath shone forth above the horizon of certitude. // O Báqir! Read and call thou to mind that which was said of old by a believer of thy stock: "Will ye slay a man because he saith my Lord is God, when He hath already come to you with signs from your Lord? If he be a liar, on him will be his lie, but if he be a man of truth, part of what he threateneth will fall upon you. In truth God guideth not him who is a transgressor, a liar." // O thou who art gone astray! If thou hast any doubt concerning Our conduct, know thou that We bear witness unto that whereunto God hath Himself borne witness ere the creation of the heavens and of the earth, that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Bounteous. We testify that He is One in His Essence, One in His attributes. He hath none to equal Him in the whole universe, nor any partner in all creation. He hath sent forth His Messengers, and sent down His Books, that they may announce unto His creatures the Straight Path. // Hath the Sháh been informed, and chosen to close his eyes to thine acts? Or hath he been seized with fear at the howling of a pack of wolves who have cast the Path of God behind their backs and followed in thy way without any clear proof or Book? We have heard that the provinces of Persia have been adorned with the adornment of justice. When We observed closely, however, We found them to be the dawning-places of tyranny and the daysprings of injustice. We behold justice in the clutches of tyranny. We beseech God to set it free through the power of His might and His sovereignty. He, verily, overshadoweth all that is in the heavens and on earth. To none is given the right to protest against anyone concerning that which hath befallen the Cause of God. It behoveth whosoever hath set his face towards the Most Sublime Horizon to cleave tenaciously unto the cord of patience, and to put his reliance in God, the Help in Peril, the Unconstrained. O ye loved ones of God! Drink your fill from the well-spring of wisdom, and walk ye in the garden of wisdom, and soar ye in the atmosphere of wisdom, and speak forth with wisdom and eloquence. Thus biddeth you your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. // O Báqir! Rely not on thy glory, and thy power. Thou art even as the last trace of sunlight upon the mountain-top. Soon will it fade away, as decreed by God, the All-Possessing, the Most High. Thy glory and the glory of such as are like thee have been taken away, and this verily is what hath been ordained by the One with Whom is the Mother Tablet. Where is he to be found who contended with God, and whither is gone he that gainsaid His signs, and turned aside from His sovereignty? Where are they who have slain His chosen ones and spilt the blood of His holy ones? Reflect, that haply thou mayest perceive the breaths of thine acts, O foolish doubter! Because of you the Apostle lamented, and the Chaste One cried out, and the countries were laid waste, and darkness fell upon all regions. O concourse of divines! Because of you the people were abased, and the banner of Islam was hauled down, and its mighty throne subverted. Every time a man of discernment hath sought to hold fast unto that which would exalt Islam, ye raised a clamour, and thereby was he deterred from achieving his purpose, while the land remained fallen in clear ruin. // Consider the Sultán of Turkey! He did not want war, but those like you desired it. When its fires were enkindled and its flames rose high, the government and the people were thereby weakened. Unto this beareth witness every man of equity and perception. Its calamities waxed so great that the smoke thereof surrounded the Land of Mystery and its environs, and what had been revealed in the Tablet of the Sultán was made manifest. Thus hath it been decreed in the Book, at the behest of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. "Verily, we are God's, and unto Him shall we return." // O My Supreme Pen! Leave Thou the mention of the Wolf, and call Thou to remembrance the She-Serpent whose cruelty hath caused all created things to groan, and the limbs of the holy ones to quake. Thus biddeth Thee the Lord of all names, in this glorious station. The Chaste One hath cried out by reason of thine iniquity, and yet thou dost imagine thyself to be of the family of the Apostle of God! Thus hath thy soul prompted thee, O thou who hast withdrawn thyself from God, the Lord of all that hath been and shall be. Judge thou equitably, O She-Serpent! For what crime didst thou sting the children of the Apostle of God, and pillage their possessions? Hast thou denied Him Who created thee by His command "be, and it was"? Thou hast dealt with the children of the Apostle of God as neither 'Ád hath dealt with Húd, nor Thamúd with Sálih, nor the Jews with the Spirit of God, the Lord of all being. Gainsayest thou the signs of thy Lord which no sooner were sent down from the heaven of His Cause than all the books of the world bowed down before them? Meditate, that thou mayest be made aware of thine act, O heedless outcast! Ere long will the breaths of chastisement seize thee, as they seized others before thee. Wait, O thou who hast joined partners with God, the Lord of the visible and the invisible. This is the day which God hath announced through the tongue of His Apostle. Reflect, that thou mayest apprehend what the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Qur'án and in this inscribed Tablet. This is the day whereon He Who is the Dayspring of Revelation hath come with clear tokens which none can number. This is the day whereon every man endued with perception hath discovered the fragrance of the breeze of the All-Merciful in the world of creation, and every man of insight hath hastened unto the living waters of the mercy of His Lord, the King of Kings. O heedless one! The tale of the Sacrifice (Ishmael) hath been retold, and he who was to be offered up hath directed his steps towards the place of sacrifice, and returned not, by reason of that which thy hand hath wrought, O perverse hater! Didst thou imagine that martyrdom could abase this Cause? Nay, by Him Whom God hath made to be the Repository of His Revelation, if thou be of them that comprehend. Woe betide thee, O thou who hast joined partners with God, and woe betide them that have taken thee as their leader, without a clear token or a perspicuous Book. How numerous the oppressors before thee who have arisen to quench the light of God, and how many the impious who murdered and pillaged until the hearts and souls of men groaned by reason of their cruelty! The sun of justice hath been obscured, inasmuch as the embodiment of tyranny hath been stablished upon the throne of hatred, and yet the people understand not. The children of the Apostle have been slain and their possessions pillaged. Say: Was it, in thine estimation, their possessions or themselves that denied God? Judge fairly, O ignorant one that hath been shut out as by a veil from God. Thou hast clung to tyranny and cast away justice; whereupon all created things have lamented, and still thou art among the wayward. Thou hast put to death the aged, and plundered the young. Thinkest thou that thou wilt consume that which thine iniquity hath amassed? Nay, by Myself! Thus informeth thee He Who is cognizant of all. By God! The things thou possessest shall profit thee not, nor what thou hast laid up through thy cruelty. Unto this beareth witness thy Lord, the All-Knowing. Thou hast arisen to put out the light of this Cause; ere long will thine own fire be quenched, at His behest. He, verily, is the Lord of strength and of might. The changes and chances of the world, and the powers of the nations, cannot frustrate Him. He doeth what He pleaseth, and ordaineth what He willeth through the power of His sovereignty. Consider the she-camel. Though but a beast, yet hath the All-Merciful exalted her to so high a station that the tongues of the earth made mention of her and celebrated her praise. He, verily, overshadoweth all that is in the heavens and on earth. No God is there but Him, the Almighty, the Great. Thus have We adorned the heaven of Our Tablet with the suns of Our words. Blessed the man that hath attained thereunto and been illumined with their light, and woe betide such as have turned aside, and denied Him, and strayed far from Him. Praised be God, the Lord of the worlds.

What the Early Believers

And Those Informed of the Matter

Have Written Concerning the Martyrdom of the

Twin Shining Lights

*A portion of the Treatise*

*Of the Late Abu'l-Fadá'il-i-Gulpáygání Describing the Martyrdom of the*

*Twin Shining Lights*

The late Abu'l-Fadá'il Muhammad Ibn-i-Muhammad-Ridáy-i-Gulpáygání, known as "Abu'l-Fadl," has provided, in a treatise he wrote in answer to one who had inquired concerning the attempt of the Bábís on the life of the Sháh, a description of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights. A portion of his treatise, taken from the notebook of Áqáy-i-Fadlu'lláh-i-Shahídí (the son of his honour Ustád 'Alí-Akbar-i-Mi'már-i-Yazdí, who was martyred in 1321 A.H. in Yazd), is now provided.

*His words, upon him be 9:*

Áqá Mírzá Hasan-i-Isfahání, who was a fruitful bough of the 'Alawite tree, was around the time of his martyrdom seeking repayment of a sum of nearly eighteen thousand túmáns owed him by Mír Muhammad-Husayn, the Imám-Jum'ih of Isfahán. The inner baseness and depraved character of the latter induced him, however, in repayment of the Mírzá's favours, to seek rather to compass the death of that noble Siyyid; and to this end he thought long and hard, and trod in his mind many tortuous and dusty byways, in order to determine how to put his scheme into effect. One day he consulted with Shaykh Báqir in the public bath, and the outcome of the just deliberations of these reverend Shí'ite clerics was that they should seek, through the lure of the Mírzá's wealth, to awaken the avarice of his excellency Zillu's-Sultán, and by this means make him a party to their scheme. Thus it was that the agents of the government and the representatives of the Sharí'ah colluded and collaborated in the Mírzá's death. When on the seventeenth of Rabí'u'l-Avval, which is the anniversary of the Prophet's birthday, the three brothers -- Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan, and Mírzá Ismá'íl -- paid a courtesy call on the Imám-Jum'ih in his home, as is customary on feast days, that ill-conditioned, hard-hearted scoundrel, judging the moment to be propitious to his design, gave orders for the two illustrious brothers to be arrested; and, having sent after the Mírzá, who was not then present, had him arrested also, and despatched those three peerless siblings to his excellency Zillu's-Sultán, who likewise ordered them to be imprisoned. During the days of their captivity, he several times summoned the Mírzá and spoke with him. On one such occasion he addressed him thus: "The Imám-Jum'ih and the rest of the 'ulamá' are aggrieved that thou hast embraced the new Cause." The Mírzá replied: "In sooth, 'tis true; but the cause of the Imám-Jum'ih's enmity towards me is rather that for several years I provided his and his family's food and clothing expenses, for the which he is indebted to me: and since I have in these days requested repayment of my debt, I have become afflicted with his enmity." The prince replied: "Granted that this is true, do thou nevertheless renounce this faith, and curse the leaders of this religion." The Mírzá remained silent, whereupon Zillu's-Sultán, taking the matter to an extreme, asserted: "By the salt of his most exalted royal majesty I swear, and by the pure soul of the Commander of the Faithful I vow: if thou wilt pronounce this curse, there is no respect in which I shall stint thee my succour and support. I shall recover thy due from the Imám-Jum'ih, and see to it that thine enemies are confounded and frustrated." Again that embodiment of steadfastness gave no reply. Finally, the prince conjured him: "By my life, I charge thee to curse them!" Yet still his words had no effect. Seeing how the matter lay, the prince waxed wroth, and asked: "Why then wilt thou not curse them?" The Mírzá replied: "Were his excellency to know what I know, he would not have laid upon me such a charge." Upon hearing these words, an extraordinary change became apparent in his temper; he was seized with great ire, and the fire of savagery and the heat of passion so blazed within him that he forsook his natural state, and his countenance turned a livid hue. He several times reached for his sword and half withdrew it from its sheath. Finally he took up a riding-switch and so plied it about the head and face of that mountain of steadfastness that his blessed features were injured. In the same interrogation Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn also refused to renounce his faith through execration. Tenderness of years and youth prevented Mírzá Ismá'íl however from emulating his two happy-starred brothers; and, by renouncing the true Faith, he secured his release and freedom. The Imám-Jum'ih and others became now apprehensive lest the Mírzá's holy lineage or personal wealth should operate to ensure his safety and deliverance. In order, therefore, that they might complete this business, they resolved once more to take counsel together, and, in the meeting subsequently convened, agreed after consultation to submit a report of the matter to his highness the Sháh, and to obtain at the same time permission to put the Mírzá to death. They accordingly despatched a telegram to Hájí Mullá 'Alíy-i-Kandí, who is today the leading cleric in Tihrán, requesting him to represent to his most exalted royal majesty that the divines of Isfahán, in token of their allegiance to his most exalted imperial majesty, had apprehended and imprisoned two Bábís, and entreated that he grant them leave to put them to death, so that they might through this service be accounted among those who demonstrated their allegiance to the crown in very fact. When this telegram reached the Sháh, he ordered his excellency Zillu's-Sultán to send them in chains to Tihrán. After reading this decree, Zillu's-Sultán made no haste to have the Mírzá put to death. The Imám-Jum'ih and Shaykh Báqir knew however that the Sháh would not wish to be involved in the death of those two innocents, and that their journey to the capital city would without doubt result in their release. Wherefore, having for a third time taken counsel together, they jointly resolved to carry the matter through by a general insurrection. Accordingly, on 23 of Rabí'u'l-Avval 1296, they first ordered the different guilds of traders in the bazaar to shut up shop; then the divines, such as the Imám-Jum'ih; Shaykh Báqir; Hájí Mírzá Háshim, the son of the previous Imám-Jum'ih; Mírzá 'Abdu'l-Javád, the son of Áqá Muhammad-Mihdíy-i-Kalbásí; Áqá Siyyid 'Alíy-i-Burújirdí, and other learned doctors of Isfahán -- more than fifty all told -- each one mounted upon his steed, and accompanied by a huge crowd of ne'er-do-wells and insurrectionaries, tradespeople and shopkeepers from the bazaar, made their way to the government citadel. With cries of "Woe to the Faith!" "Woe to the Sharí'ah!," they stirred up a prodigious tumult in the city, to the degree that a reliable authority has related that their savage cries could be heard even as far away as Qal'iy-i-Gaz, three farsangs distant from Isfahán. His excellency Zillu's-Sultán, who was at this time in the bath, was perturbed by the people's clamour; and upon inquiring who they were, and what had caused them to congregate and assemble in this manner, was informed, "It is the 'ulamá and their followers. They are saying: 'We can no longer exercise patience and rest quiet in the matter of the Mírzá: we entreat his excellency to have him put to death, for otherwise we shall ourselves carry through this business by main force.'" Emerging from the bath, his excellency Zillu's-Sultán sent for the divines, who, after coming into his presence, presented to him their demand. The prince advised them: "These have committed naught prejudicial or treasonable to the state. Your argument with them is over a religious and a confessional matter; whereas I am not concerned with matters connected to the Faith. Moreover, his most exalted royal majesty hath commanded me to despatch them to Tihrán. Consequently I am unable to pass upon them the sentence of death." The divines then said: "We will issue their death sentence, and ourselves answer to the Sháh for the proceeding;" to which the prince replied: "I will not delegate to my executioner the task of carrying out your sentence." A few of the 'ulamá', among them Shaykh Muhammad-Taqí, the son of Shaykh Báqir, known as Shaykh Najafí, now rolled up their sleeves in the assembly, exclaiming, "We ourselves shall with our own hands put them to death." When the prince saw how bold and intrepid were these stony-hearted petitioners in demanding the innocents' blood, he said, "In that case, do ye write down their death sentence upon a sheet of paper, and deposit it with me, that it may be my warrant." The 'ulamá' accordingly wrote out as directed a document importing the necessity of having the Mírzá put to death, and some sixty people, more or less, all of whom were present and assembled in that meeting, affixed their seal and testimony to the deed, and sent it to the prince. When the prince set eyes upon that document, he ordered that the foundation of loftiness and glory be felled by the axe of tyranny, and the fruitful sapling of nobility and honour be cut down by the sword of oppression and enmity. Once the order had been issued for the execution of those twin shining stars of the heaven of holy lineage, the demon-hearted executioners brought them forth from their place of confinement, and beside the "Tálár-i-Tavílih" building, which is a well-known edifice of Isfahán, and a monument of the Safavid monarchy, spilt their blood, which was the very spirit of purity and the soul of virtue, upon the ground. After their martyrdom, a cord was tied about their feet, and their pure bodies were dragged to the foot of the gallows. The prince ordered a number of farráshes to keep watch around their corses, and to prevent the people from throwing stones at them and from perpetrating other indignities they had been seen committing. Those two pure temples remained that day until the evening fallen upon the dust at the foot of the gallows. At this hour, Shaykh Báqir ordered the bodies to be placed beneath an arch near the Níyásarm river, and the arch to be knocked down over them. Thereafter, his excellency Zillu's-Sultán, having summoned Mírzá Ismá'íl to appear before him, ordered him to bury those two pure bodies, and the latter accordingly laid them to rest in the Takhtih-Púlád cemetery. *Finis*.

Concerning

The Martyrdom of the

Twin Shining Lights

*An Account of the Martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights*

*By the Pen of the Late Mírzá Asadu'lláh Fádil-i-Mázindarání*

The two famed martyrs, alike of the spirit and of the flesh, were descendants of the pure prophetic line, and beauteous and fragrant blossoms of the garden of Ahmad. They were named after their holy Ancestor's two martyred grandsons, Hasan and Husayn, and were born, as they resided, in Isfahán, one of the magnificent cities of Írán. In honour, glory and wealth they were distinguished above their peers; while in the firmament of the Cause of His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh they were as twin shining stars. During the years 1844 to 1845, which witnessed the first breaking of the dawn of Truth, the heaven of this family was illumined by the supernal lights, and its members were dignified and honoured with the raiments of Divine guidance. In 1846 when, as a result of the clamour raised by the Muslim divines, and the ensuing governmental decree, His Holiness the Báb forsook his native town of Shíráz for Isfahán, and those in that city who panted after the fount of knowledge, and earnestly sought for religious truth, had the bounty of meeting Him, and of satisfying their thirst, their esteemed father, Mírzá Ibráhím, invited Him one night to his home, and illumined his humble abode with the lights of his august Visitor's presence. That night the showers of the clouds of bounty and bestowal rained down without pause, and the choicest delicacies of His heavenly table continually descended. From thenceforth the lights of guidance by degrees completely irradiated the spiritual horizons of that family, so that they became renowned for their affiliation to this Cause, and grew in the Divine garden into a lofty palm and a fruitful tree. When His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh, pursuant to the Iranian government's decree of banishment, was exiled from that land, and in 1852 His blessed train arrived with kingly splendour in Baghdád; and when, for a period of twelve years, that city became a dawning-place of the lights of guidance, a centre for the diffusion of truth, and a resort for religionists and philosophers, those two brothers journeyed thither on one occasion from Isfahán, and for a few hours entered into His holy presence, attained the paradise of nearness and reunion; and quaffed from the sweet palatable stream flowing from the Divine fountain. They became inebriated with the soul-reviving wine of the love of God; obtained all they wished for; and realized their highest hopes. Of the Source of grace and bounty they besought that they might scale the heights of glory and wealth; and their petition was honoured with acceptance and assent. When they returned to Isfahán, they each, like royal falcons, soared up on twin mighty pinions to the very apex of earthly and heavenly advancement. They were seen to have become a "new creation," and a wondrous spirit shone effulgently in their holy temples. Their faces betokened gladness at the gifts and favours of God, and their hearts were a mirror of the lights of the All-Glorious. They had each a countenance bright and shining, and a character like unto a rose-garden. A sweet tongue and an eloquent and grateful utterance were theirs; and a treasury of mind and heart filled with the precious gems of knowledge and spiritual sensibilities, so that they were rich in the plenty of God, and thereby able to dispense with all save Him. Yet with all this, they became celebrated too for their material prosperity; and in consequence of the commerce in which they were engaged, wealth and riches poured in continually and ceaselessly from all sides, whence they acquired rank, glory and great affluence; their business operations extended far and wide; and their trade relations with other cities were uninterrupted. They were turned to as authorities on important civic matters, while people of stature and eminence, whether influential divines, wealthy merchants or dignitaries of state, associated and entered into dealings with them, looked to them for help and support, and held them in esteem. At the same time, they were a shelter for the poor, and a refuge for the orphaned and widowed. They were a rescuer of the fallen, and a boundless treasure to the abject and destitute. They were a healer of the sick, and a harbourer of those without victuals and provisions for their journey. They disappointed no petitioner, and were a source of hope unto the despondent. The door of their bounty and generosity stood open before all, to the degree that in the year when Isfahán was stricken with famine, these two brothers, through dispensing money, storing up supplies, and giving charitably to all, saved the people from starvation, and delivered them from perdition. Although in that era the fanatical outcry of the people against the Bahá'ís was exceeding fierce -- the influential Muslim divines issued sentences declaring them heretics and condemning them to death, sentences which the government of the time, whether willingly or not, carried into effect, so that each day the world would hear of new forms and varieties of slaughter, rapine and incarceration directed against the Bahá'ís, especially in Isfahán, which occupied in this respect a foremost rank among the cities of Írán, inasmuch as a very wealthy and hugely influential Muslim divine of the city had on numerous occasions, whether by edict or incitement, caused the death of many members of this community, and even as a wolf, which steals off the inoffensive lambs one by one, then stains its claws and teeth with their blood, had spilt the blood of a host of innocent victims, whence he was designated the "Wolf" (and now he and his son, who succeeded to his position, are famed by the appellations "Wolf" and "Son of the Wolf," and a long and weighty epistle wherein Bahá'u'lláh rebuked him has become known throughout the world under the title "The Book of the Shaykh," or the "Epistle to the Son of the Wolf"); the government of Isfahán was moreover under the wilful sway of a despotic, oppressive, voluptuous, and covetous prince, who executed many people without cause, and stole incalculable wealth, a man who seemed to derive peculiar pleasure from shedding the blood of the oppressed, and visiting cruelty upon the innocent (and were the full tale of the oppression and cruelty of this divine and governor to be set forth, it would of itself fill up a thick and bulky volume) -- *at such a time as this,* the aforementioned two brothers kept the door of their home open to the generality of the believers, nor ever for a moment were remiss in discharging their Bahá'í obligations, or had any fear or apprehension of anyone. Nay rather, in that city they were the standard-bearers of this Blessed Cause, and the defenders of the victims of oppression; and whenever the enemy launched an attack or assault against any of these wronged ones, they would contrive by various means to protect them, and strive to ensure their safety. Their home was moreover accounted a place of resort for Bahá'í travellers, whether arriving or departing, and for the holding of formal assemblies and gatherings. They had absolutely no fear or trepidation of the enmity of the divines, or of the possibility of a general onslaught of the people, and were so inebriated with the wine of love and faith that they were entirely oblivious of self. They seemed not to be walking on earth, but to be soaring in a different and limitless world, as is indeed attested by a petition they submitted to His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh during the days of His sojourn in Baghdád, wherein they expressed their wish for martyrdom, and for the shedding of their blood, so that the tree of the Cause of God might grow, and they themselves ascend unto the Divine Kingdom. Truth to say, in the world of the soul and the heart they had already, when they made this request, arrived at the station of true martyrdom -- that is, of detachment from their own wishes and desires, and selflessness in the Will of the True One. In brief, matters continued in this wise for a period, until, in 1879, there occurred the fearful and extraordinary event of their martyrdom, the manner of which is as follows. There was in that same city of Isfahán another hugely influential Muslim leader whom the autocratic and all-powerful governor viewed with respect. This cleric, designated by Bahá'u'lláh as the "She-Serpent" ("An adornéd serpent filled with venom") had dealings with the two brothers, and his property was entrusted to their supervision. They had gradually lent him considerable sums of money, amounting perhaps to as much as twenty thousand dollars, and in the stated year, requested of him repayment of these debts. At this, a satanic notion came into the cleric's head, and he determined, by accusing them of affiliation to the Cause of God, to make away with them; and, so far from paying back the aforesaid debts, wrongfully to lay hands on their vast wealth, and to appropriate it to himself. Accordingly he broached in private his satanic notion with the aforesaid wolfish Shaykh, and the latter, by revealing his own unmitigated enmity and bloodthirstiness of disposition, satisfied him that he might rely upon his concurrence and collaboration. With a single purpose therefore they determined to put this dastardly deed into effect. Together, they met with the prince-governor; removed the seal from this hidden secret; and represented to him that the said brothers, on account of the importance of their station, their widespread popularity, and their excellent parts, would gradually attract and allure the people to the Cause of His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh, and so bring about the demise of Islám. "Wherefore," they impressed upon him, "It is incumbent upon thee to take measures so that we may eradicate and suppress them." The prince at first demurred, seeking by various pretexts to excuse himself from the course proposed. "In the first place," he said, "No one hath witnessed any improper action on their part; rather are they adorned with virtues and actions well-pleasing alike to God and to man. For what crime, then, should they suffer torment?" They replied: "There is no greater crime than to depart from the fold of Islám, and enter under the shadow of a new Cause." "In the second place," the prince continued, "They are children of His Holiness Muhammad, whence a responsibility is entailed before the Court of God." Again they replied: "We are to answer for it, and the burden thereof is upon our necks, inasmuch as we are the real perpetrators." The She-Serpent, whose heart was impatient and restless for their death, placed his hand upon his neck as if to say, "I shall bear this burden." "In the third place," the prince persisted, "They have dealings with merchants throughout the land, and this course will undoubtedly involve them in loss, and provoke from them loud cries of protest. The Sháh too may call me to account." To this however they made reply, "We take full responsibility for the proceeding, and shall undertake in writing ourselves to answer to the traders and to the Sháh." So saying, they wrote out with their own hand a document, and deposited it with the prince, tempting him at the same time with the assurance that a bountiful share of the victims' vast wealth would fall to his lot. Thus it was that the prince too became their accessary and confidant, and they determined to prosecute the business together, resolving for the time being to keep it secret, so that none should become apprised of it in advance. So the matter stood until the anniversary of the birth of His Holiness Muhammad -- a regular feast day, on which it is customary for people to pay courtesy visits to the governor and to the divines. Among the great company of people from different ranks of society who assembled in the home of the She-Serpent on that day, a body of the prince-governor's henchmen were also present. These awaited but the opportunity to put into effect a preconcerted plan, which was that when, in accordance with the aforesaid custom, the two brothers came to pay their compliments to the divine, they were first rudely to accost, and then to arrest, them. It chanced that the elder of the two brothers, the Beloved of Martyrs, arrived in the assembly with their younger brother, and while they were seated and occupied with drinking tea, the She-Serpent began fiercely to berate them, saying, "Ye are Bahá'ís, infidels, unclean, and misleaders of the Muslims." By his order, they were then set upon, and the cups of tea taken from their hands, and cast away; after which the prince's farráshes dragged them in the most demeaning manner into their master's presence. The She-Serpent, being uninformed of the whereabouts of the illustrious middle brother, the King of Martyrs, now detailed a company to go in search of him and seek him out; and when at length word arrived that the object of their quest was in the home of one of the well-known divines of the city, he sent thither a company of his own henchmen to arrest him. The divine in question, however, bore the utmost love towards the King of Martyrs; was well pleased alike by his thoughts, his manners and his attainments; and observed towards him the utmost respect and consideration. The King of Martyrs had moreover informed him upon his arrival that a fearful event would that day befall, occasioned by the scheming of the She-Serpent, who, purely out of covetousness for his wealth, had taken decisive measures to compass his death. His host, emboldened by his family connection with the prince, had in response offered him a refuge in his home; and was declaring with the utmost assurance that he would inform the prince of the She-Serpent's scheme, nor allow aught untoward to take place, when of a sudden the tumult of the She-Serpent's henchmen who had come in search of him reached their ears. The divine charged his servants to refuse their demand, and they accordingly returned to the She-Serpent, and explained to him what had happened. He in turn relayed this information to the prince, insisting that the recusant divine should be admonished. The prince forthwith despatched to the latter's house one of his most important and redoubtable functionaries, accompanied by more than a hundred pages, with strict orders to arrest the King of Martyrs; and at the same time directed to the divine a letter in which he warned him to desist from extending his protection, inasmuch as to oppose the determination and pleasure of such influential clerics would entail the most baneful consequences. When these rough and overbearing officials descended upon that house, and the divine saw how matters stood, he perforce with the utmost sorrow and regret apprised the King of Martyrs of the turn events had taken. The latter, with no trace of sorrow or vexation, but evincing rather perfect contentment, at once hied forth from his refuge, and hastened unto the arena of sacrifice in the path of love. When he emerged, that group of officials encompassed him on all sides and hauled him before the governor as though he were a dangerous felon. In this woeful and piteous condition, as he was being thus borne along, the mass of the people, coming out into the streets and squares, bit their fingers in token of bewilderment, and chastened wonder at the inconstancy of fortune, whilst a few among them wept. He, however, showed forth such joy and thankfulness that one might have thought him to be on his way to a festive and gladsome celebration. When they drew nigh the imposing government building, he bestowed, in front of the assembled throng, his watch and a few items of his precious raiment as a bounty upon that same functionary of the prince, and begged his pardon, for, as he explained, "At present this is all I have to give." Upon entering the presence-chamber of the prince-governor, he found his brothers already there before him. The moment he arrived, the governor began to expostulate with him, and fell to reproving and maligning his religion, his creed and his belief. To this, however, he replied with the utmost courtesy: "Excellency, wert thou too to know what I know, never wouldst thou allow such unbefitting language, and such improper expressions, to pass thy lips." At this the prince was exceeding wrathful, and with violent cuffs and swipes of a cane, struck and injured his hands, head, face and body, sternly charging him to renounce his belief in the Cause of God, and to speak of it in unseemly terms. His victim however preserved his silence, thereby only further inflaming the prince's ire. The aforementioned divine who bore love towards him was also present, and when he saw that from excess of thirst the tongue of the King of Martyrs clave to his palate, he ordered water to be brought. The latter took the water, and with perfect decorum sated his thirst. In the utmost bewilderment and amazement, the prince bespake the divine: "'Tis wonderful: even under such circumstances he forgoeth not the courtesy and good manners which are his badge!" At all events, when he observed how firm was the foundation of the brothers' faith, and how steadfast they were in their belief and conviction, with unbridled anger he ordered that they be consigned to prison, and there held fast in heavy chains and fetters. In the course of executing this order, his rapacious farráshes stripped them of their raiment. The She-Serpent for his part despatched a party of his minions to ransack their home. These, having brutally herded their wives, family and children -- who in the extremity of terror were trembling and weeping -- into a corner, and set ruffians to watch over them, kept them pent up, hungry and parched, while they looted and plundered whatever money, jewels, and furnishings the house contained. They then proceeded to their commercial chamber, and likewise bore off all they came across. The She-Serpent also sent someone to the prison, who confiscated any documents and instruments he discovered in the folds of the brothers' clothing; and he similarly seized from the bazaar all records of claims they had upon money-changers and others. He even impounded on that day a camel train of theirs, which he appropriated to himself. During the period of their confinement, merchants throughout the land sent numerous telegrams to the prince-governor advising him that if harm were inflicted upon them it would entail financial loss, and lead to a wholesale weakening of trade. It was bruited that the Sháh too sent a telegram to the prince, instructing him to despatch the captives to Tihrán. But the lust of Mammon, and dread of the consequences of crossing the Wolf and the She-Serpent, eventually decided him instead to expedite their execution, and to place the responsibility for it entirely upon the shoulders of the two divines, only advising receipt of the telegram after the deed was done. Although during the said period he several times urged the two distinguished brothers to renounce their allegiance to the Cause of God, and so ensure their safety and deliverance, representing to them, "Say but this, 'We are not Bahá'ís,' and it shall be sufficient;" while on each occasion those two prodigies of steadfastness raised the cry of "Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!," and in resonant tones proclaimed, "Our highest wish is to sacrifice our lives for the love of the Manifestation of Truth, and to spread His Divine teachings;" so that finally he was content to take from them an exorbitant sum, and to overlook the demand that they either renounce their faith or face execution; and even received part of the sum agreed upon, which amounted to nearly thirteen thousand dollars, and granted the youngest brother Mírzá Ismá'íl permission to go forth from the prison in order to procure the remaining sums -- *yet the Wolf and the She-Serpent,* who were in the utmost haste to have them put to death, convened on the seventh day of their confinement a meeting in the presence of the prince, to which they invited a host of learned jurisprudents, and there urgently pressed him to carry through his original intention; unreservedly took upon themselves whatever responsibility, earthly or heavenly, might be involved; and signed and sealed the sentence condemning those two noble souls to death. "Ye then are the slayers," the prince announced; and with this he bade his swordsman carry out whatever the two oppressors might demand, while these in turn bade him expedite the execution. The executioner, his blade unsheathed, entered the prison just as the illustrious elder was addressing to his younger brother the following words of counsel: "O my brother! It is I whose death these oppressors principally seek. If thou but say, 'The Bahá'í is my brother, and not myself,' thou shalt be saved; and after my death thou shalt maintain and care for my poor wife, family and little ones;" to which the latter replied, "O my brother! The One True Beloved will Himself look after our survivors in the best possible manner; whereas the requirement of fidelity is that we two brothers should be together in all the worlds of God." At first the swordsman, who had for years been regaled at the table of their bounty and generosity, besought their pardon, and begged them, "Speak but the word of denial so that ye may be saved, and I for my part spared the need to commit so deplorable a deed." "Thou art under orders," the King of Martyrs addressed him, "Go therefore about thy business." That sanguinary tyrant accordingly led out the great-hearted pair to the scene of execution, where he firmly blindfolded them. As soon as he wished to commence his work, however, each of the twain strove to be the first to suffer martyrdom, and to hasten from this world ahead of his companion, while the other resisted his demands; and so their altercation continued for well nigh an hour. The Wolf and the She-Serpent, who, pacing together on a place of vantage, were complacently and expectantly engaged in converse, gazing the while upon this affecting spectacle, determinedly signalled to the swordsman forthwith to perform his duty and complete his task. Accordingly, while the two brothers, with their arms about each other's necks, were exclaiming "Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!," and yielding thanks unto God, he smote off their heads, and their blessed bodies fell to the earth, and became covered in gore and dust. A cord was then affixed to their feet, and they were dragged over the ground to the Maydán-i-Sháh, where they were deposited for the mass of the people to stare upon. Later, they were dragged from thence, and set in a waste spot beneath a massive and ruined wall, which was then knocked down over them so that their bodies were contused and crushed together by its weight, and concealed from view. In the dead of night, however, their younger brother, Mírzá Ismá'íl, accompanied by several of his servants, extricated those precious bodies from beneath the earth, debris and rubble, and bore them off to a spot beside the Záyandih Rúd outside the city, where he washed and shrouded them. In order to excavate a grave for them, he had brought with him also a party of workmen, and these, while expressing apprehension and alarm lest anyone should notice them, and the matter come to the attention of the Wolf and the She-Serpent, nevertheless dug two separate graves, interred the two corses in that spot, and, still in a state of the utmost fear and perturbation, returned to their homes. In their blindness of heart, the oppressors, especially the wolfish Shaykh, imagined that by slaying these two distinguished souls they would be able to extirpate the Cause of God; and that by uprooting these twin fruitful trees, no trace or sign of the Divine orchard would remain. In the wake of this incident spies were set about to the end that if any Bahá'í were discovered to have entered the city, or if any meeting or gathering, or other appearance or manifestation of activity, were observed, all those involved would be put to death. Emphatic instructions were likewise issued to the clerics and others in the madrasihs to be on their guard; while a search and investigation were instituted to locate the burial place of the twin martyrs, so that their bodies might be disinterred. Yet despite such measures, the patience and fortitude of these two distinguished souls in bearing calamity, and in renouncing wealth and family for the sake of the Almighty; and withal their acceptance of this trial with contentment, and of their own free will, became a consummate testimony to the power and pervasive majesty of this Cause. In particular, the grandeur and consequence of their stations, whether in the social or the moral spheres, as well as their piety, virtuous character and detachment, made plain and evident the importance, and the potent influence, of this Mighty Cause in man's spiritual education, whilst exposing before high and low alike the evil character, the tyranny, and the inhuman selfishness of those in authority. In truth, the effect of this supreme calamity was not felt by the Bahá'ís alone, for many devoted adherents of other religions too were plunged into grief and mourning, and composed on the subject verses such as the following:

Methinks in heaven's quiver was not another shaft than this.

Not long thereafter the She-Serpent and the prince fell out, and the She-Serpent took flight and disappeared. Then, on that very part of his neck where he had clapped his hand, so assuming the whole responsibility for their death, a boil broke out, which became so cankered and infected that all his relatives shrank from him in abhorrence, and, removing him from the house, placed him in a garden without the city, where at length he died of this same ailment. The wolfish Shaykh and the son of the Wolf were likewise abased and humiliated, and, like fruitless trees, became otiose and unproductive. The prince for his part was after a while rejected and ostracized by the Sháh, and sank to the lowest level of abasement and ignominy. Finally he was rejected by the whole populace of Írán, and compelled to live outside the realm. On one occasion he returned to Írán, intending to enjoy peaceably for a time in his native land the vast wealth he had accumulated by whatever means he pleased; but the people would not gratify this wish; held him captive; and treated him in the harshest and most humiliating manner. At this juncture it is pertinent to relate the following story. An oppressed Bahá'í of Isfahán, who at the time of the tyrannical government of this same prince suffered under the scourge of the rapacious clerics, and was wont, on account of the fear and danger in which he dwelt, to hide in nooks and corners, appealed to him on one occasion, invoking the ardent sighs of those whose hearts had been melted by oppression, and the moans and lamentations of those without a refuge to flee to; and reminding him of his responsibility before the Divine Threshold; in reply to which the latter, with the utmost arrogance and derision, reproached him, saying: "Go, take thy plaint of me to 'Abdu'l-Bahá, so that He may deal with me as He is able." It was above all this taunting reproach which seared the chagrined heart of that oppressed believer. Years later when, condemned and ostracized, the prince was held captive by the people on the borders of the realm, prohibited from entering his native land, and living in the utmost abasement and humiliation, this same believer journeyed thither from his distant abode, and, having met him, and introduced himself, reminded him of their previous encounter, saying: "In such and such a year when I complained to thee of the injustices and oppression I was suffering, telling thee that all my property had been plundered; that I had no place where I could be safe or at ease; and that I was continually in hiding for fear of my enemies, thou didst bid me go take my complaint to 'Abdu'l-Bahá. Outwardly, I made no complaint to Him; yet the exigency of Divine justice is reward and punishment, even as His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh hath said: 'The canopy of world order is upraised upon the two pillars of reward and punishment.' Wherefore is such recompense doomed and inevitable." In fine, under such conditions these powerful enemies passed from the world, and their lamp was extinguished. Their honours the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, however, kindled a lamp that will for ever shine refulgent, while from each day of their lives up to their final martyrdom a blissful fragrance was shed abroad that shall always perfume the nostrils of the spiritual. Upon the twain His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh hath bestowed Tablets, favours, and the heavenly titles "King of Martyrs" and "Beloved of Martyrs," by which twin beatific names they are now famed throughout the East and the West. *Finis*.

The Account of the Well-known Orientalist

Edward Browne

Concerning

The Martyrdom of the

Twin Shining Lights

The celebrated Orientalist Edward Browne in his well-known book *A Year Amongst the Persians* has on several occasions, sometimes briefly and at other times in detail, touched generally upon the subject of the Blessed Cause, and specifically upon that of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights. We shall at this point render into Persian from the English original the essence of some of these passages, choosing, so far as is possible, the part of concision in conveying their purport:

*Among these passages, he has written in the fifth chapter of the book, which concerns Tihrán, the following:*

The Sháh is not directly involved in the slaughter of the Bábís. The Sháh's son, Zillu's-Sultán, was the one who in 1879 A.D. had two of them put to death in Isfahán, and in 1888 caused also the death of Mírzá Ashraf-i-Ábádi'í. In the spring of 1889 the Bábís of Sidih and Najaf-Ábád suffered grievous molestation and persecution. In May 1890 Jalálu'd-Dawlih, the son of Zillu's-Sultán, and grandson of the Sháh, had seven Bahá'ís put to death in the city of Yazd. These sanguinary outrages were all occasioned indirectly by the Sháh of Írán. He gave the order, and was cognizant of the outcome. In July 1869 Mírzá Badí', having travelled all the way from 'Akká, personally delivered into the hand of the Sháh in Tihrán a long Tablet that had emanated from the pen of His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh, and the Sháh ordered him to be put to death.

*In the eighth chapter of "A Year Amongst the Persians," the author has provided a detailed account of the Twin Shining Lights, whose essence is as follows:*

A week had passed since my arrival in Isfahán. One afternoon as I was sitting unoccupied in the midst of the room, which overlooked a courtyard, considering within myself when I should set out for Shíráz and Yazd, two vendors arrived, bringing with them a quantity of rugs, old coins, brass implements, and other items. I left the room to inspect their wares, but the prices they asked for seemed to me excessive. One of the vendors was young, while the other was an old man whose beard was dyed with henna. The old man said: "Áqá! We have come far in order to bring thee these things. Thou too hast delayed us a little from our business. Shouldst thou now refrain from dealing with us, it would not be handsome of thee." I was about to say, "It was thou who camest hither, not I who sent after thee," when the young man, coming up to me, placed his mouth right next to my ear, and softly whispered, "Fear not that we shall defraud thee. Rest assured. I am no Muslim that I should wish to cozen thee. I am a Bahá'í (Bábí)." I had long been hoping to make the acquaintance of this community. I believe he imagined that the Christians were better acquainted with the Bahá'ís than were the Muslims. In any case, his words produced upon me a magical effect. All at once an opportunity had presented itself for me to fulfil the wish I had been cherishing for the last four months. When I had sufficiently recovered from the astonishment with which his words filled me to speak, I exclaimed: "Thou art a Bahá'í! From the moment of my arrival in Írán I have been hoping to meet a member of this faith. Prithee, if it be possible, provide me with a book. The things thou hast brought are of no interest to me; what I wish for is your books." The vendor said, "I shall see what I can do on thy behalf. I promise to bring thee at least one or two books. But tell me, for I am curious to know: Why art thou so eager to acquire our books? Where didst thou hear the name 'Bahá'í'? -- for to judge from the tenor of thy remarks, thou hast not yet met any of the Bahá'ís." I replied, "Years before I travelled to Írán -- or ever conceived the notion of doing so -- I had heard of your religion. A learned Frenchman who lived in Tihrán at the time of His Holiness the Báb wrote a book about the Bahá'ís, recording all the instances of torment and injury they suffered. Ever since reading that book, which is in French, I have desired to acquire further information on the subject -- an aim in which I have not so far been successful. Now however, by the grace of God, and through the assistance which thou art shortly to render me, I shall at last arrive at my object." "So the Call of the Revelation hath been heard in Frangistán too," observed the vendor, "Very good. Rest assured that I shall do all I can to assist thee, so that thou mayest be fully informed concerning this Cause. Shouldst thou be so inclined, thou mayest meet a learned and pious believer who hath suffered many vicissitudes for the sake of the Cause. With thy consent, I shall arrange for thee to meet him. This person is the chief and elder of our Bahá'í community in Isfahán, and once a fortnight visiteth each of our homes in order to ascertain that we are comfortably circumstanced, while at the same time encouraging and enthusing us. I myself am but a poor illiterate vendor; but he will tell thee all thou wishest to know." His words, which he had all this while been gently breathing into my ear, here came to an end. The old vendor, who had been awaiting with utmost impatience the conclusion of our conference, now, seeing that it was over, set aside a few items of his merchandise, which he presented to me, while I for my part bestowed upon him some money for his pains. Taking leave of them, I returned to my room, reminding the young vendor at the last moment, "See that thou forget not to bring the books! Come if thou canst tomorrow morning!" The following day, at about the same hour of their previous visit, my long-cherished wish was fulfilled, for the Bahá'í vendor arrived, and presented me with two books. I at once escorted him into my room. It happened that a devout Muslim, one Hájí Safar, was seated there, and upon my entering the room with the vendor he wished to know what was afoot. Being however afraid to utter a word in his presence, I of necessity possessed my soul in patience. Only after he had left did I receive the books from the vendor. Of the two books he had brought me, one was the Kitáb-i-Íqán, of which my companion said, "This book is very important, and containeth weighty proofs in vindication of the Blessed Cause." The other book was smaller, and, as I later understood, comprised a work of 'Abbás Effendi, the son of Bahá'u'lláh, who is these days the leader of the Bahá'ís, and resident in 'Akká, one of the towns of Syria. He wrote this book in reply to 'Alí Shawkat Páshá, who had inquired concerning the meaning of the Tradition "I was a hidden treasure." Examples of the calligraphy of one of the sons of His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh, and likewise of the penmanship of Mishkín-Qalam, were also placed in my hands. Mishkín-Qalam is among the Bahá'ís who in 1868 were exiled to Cyprus by order of the Ottoman government. My vendor companion told me that among the friends were many beautiful works of Mishkín-Qalam, especially those which, in what is known as his "avian" script, he had executed in the form of a bird. Mishkín-Qalam signs himself at the foot of his works:

*Dar díyár-i-khatt shah-i-sáhib-'alam*

*Bandiy-i-Báb-i-Bahá', Mishkín-Qalam*

Sháh of the realm of script, signal among men,

Thrall of the Gate of Bahá', "Musk-laden Pen."

Having received from him these inestimable gems, I next questioned the vendor, "Knowest thou where lie interred those twin Siyyids who, in 1879, were martyred on account of their Bahá'í affiliation?" "Ay, I know the spot well," he replied, "And shall, if thou desirest, direct thee thither. But Áqá, tell me truly: Thou, who art at such pains to obtain our books, and art ready to visit the grave of the Bahá'í martyrs; and who hast even travelled to 'Akká and met the Blessed Beauty -- I cannot but conceive that thou art a Bahá'í. Is't not so? Thou needest not conceal the matter from me." "No, my good friend," I said, "I am not a Bahá'í, nor have I ever travelled to 'Akká. It is merely that, impressed as I am by the spectacle of a new-born religion that hath reared up self-sacrificial and courageous disciples, and produced followers ready to die for their belief, to visit the grave of your martyrs, who have forgone wealth and life itself for the sake of their faith and conviction, is for me a way of showing respect for their steadfastness and courage. ...

At this moment, the old vendor entered with a number of photographs, as well as various other items. When they wished to leave, the young vendor, finding a convenient moment, whispered in my ear, "Next Saturday -- forget it not! I shall arrange for someone to meet thee in a certain part of the city, or else myself come and escort thee to my home, where thou shalt meet our honoured chief. Ere the appointed day, I shall come to inform thee of the spot where thou must wait. *Khudá Háfiz!*" Saturday at length arrived, and early in the morning my vendor companion appeared, and said, "Come thou to the entrance of such and such a caravanserai in the city, and wait there. A little after midday, my companion and I shall come to meet thee." Having readied myself, I proceeded at the stated hour to the appointed place. Erelong the old vendor arrived, and gestured to me to follow him. We passed through the bazaar, and when he knew that I was following, he ceased glancing behind him so frequently as he had at first. We pressed our steps hurriedly for half an hour until we arrived at the young Bahá'í vendor's home. The latter, having bade me welcome at the doorway, conducted me into the reception room, and, whilst awaiting the arrival of another person, busied himself preparing tea for me and the other guests. He showed me too a number of other precious objects, amongst which was a photograph of Mishkín-Qalam with his two sons; also a view of the graves of the martyrs of Isfahán, which he informed me had been taken by a European resident in the city, who had social and other ties with the martyrs. After a while, a sound of knocking was heard at the door. My host hastened to open it, and in came the Bahá'í teacher, whom he forthwith introduced to me. He was a man of pleasing aspect, dignified, about forty-five years of age. He sate down opposite me, and began drinking tea. His comportment was most agreeable, and his conversation interesting and engaging. Altogether, he was a man such as one could not forget, and whose countenance would imprint itself upon the memory of whosoever met him. The old vendor, who had left the house, now returned with one of the Bahá'í merchants. As it chanced, the presence of this respected personage somewhat circumscribed the scope of our conversation, and so I was unable to ask all I wished to know. This much, however, I gathered, that he was a well-known Bahá'í teacher who had suffered great hardship in the path of this faith, and had frequently been cast into prison, and on several occasions exiled. "Pray enlighten me," I asked him, "What was it induced thee to bear such adversity and tribulation for the sake of the Bahá'í Faith?" "Thou must visit 'Akká," he replied, "In order to apprehend the root cause of this matter." "Hast thou thyself been to 'Akká?" I inquired. "If so, what didst thou witness?" "I have indeed been to 'Akká," he replied, "And what I witnessed was this: the sum total of human perfection embodied in a mortal frame." He said no more on this head; but then continued, "As I understand it, thou art to leave Isfahán a few days hence. Fortunately there is a way in which thou mayest hear all thou desirest to know. I shall write to the friends of Shíráz and Ábádih, and tell them about thee, commending thee to their hospitality. Shouldst thou travel to other cities too, there are Bahá'ís everywhere with whom thou canst meet." He then provided me with the names of two of the friends in Ábádih and Shíráz, saying, "Make a note of these. They will come to meet thee. If thou wishest it, thou mayest associate with them. For the rest, I shall now depart. May God keep thee, and guide thee unto the right way." The young vendor said to him, "Áqá! He wisheth to visit the graves of the martyrs, and I have promised to take him thither. Shouldst thou do us the honour to join us, we would profit from thy company on the way." "It is highly commendable to visit the graves of the martyrs," he replied, "And I bless this action on his part. I shall not, however, myself accompany you, for I am known to most people, and it might not be the course of wisdom. *Khudá Háfiz!*" A little while after he departed, I too decided to take my leave. The Bahá'í merchant undertook to escort me to the entrance of the aforesaid caravanserai. Although there was no suitable opportunity for conversation on the way, he whispered to me, "Áqá, behold in what a place we live! Like rapacious beasts the people fall upon and slay us. Our sole crime is to have recognized God, and to have believed in the Manifestation of His Cause." When we arrived at the caravanserai I bade my guide farewell, and straightway returned home in order to prepare for the journey to Shíráz. A certain 'Abdu'r-Rahím from the village of Khuráskán, a carrier by trade, proved ready to hire me four of his beasts for the journey to Shíráz at a cost of three túmáns per head, agreeing that I might stop wherever I pleased along the way. I paid him half the cost of the hire, and the preparations for my journey were complete. It was a little past noon the next day when my young vendor friend came to conduct me to the graves of the martyrs. For the space of an hour we made our way beneath the blazing sun until we arrived at a large cemetery by the name of Takhtih-Fúlád. My companion looked about him, and hailed from afar a poor grave-digger, who was also a Bahá'í. The three of us set off together, eventually arriving at a place where a few stones and a quantity of fine sand met our eyes. The vendor told me, "The grave of the two martyrs is here. The reason why we have set no headstone over it is that if the Muslims see aught, they immediately come to destroy and smash it. Now will we sit here awhile, and I shall relate to thee the story of the martyrdom of these two brothers. First, however, it is fitting that our companion should read a prayer, and recite the Visitation Tablet for the martyrs." This said, he pointed to the nearer of the graves, and continued, "This is the grave of Hájí Mírzá Hasan, who is surnamed the King of Martyrs, while that other grave belongs to his elder brother, Hájí Mírzá Husayn, who is surnamed the Beloved of Martyrs." The grave-digger brought out of his pocket a small book from which he read certain Verses and prayers in Arabic and Persian; after which, as we were thus seated beside the graves, the vendor began his tale: "These two brothers were Siyyids, and engaged in commerce; yet neither their holy lineage nor their lavish bestowals to the poor and indigent could protect them from the malice of their enemies. The two brothers had lent the sum of ten thousand túmáns to Shaykh Báqir, who was one of the divines of Isfahán. Shaykh Báqir knew that both his creditors were Bahá'ís, and thought to himself that in order to be free of the debt he owed them, he could make use of their Bahá'í connection in order to have them put to death. He therefore consulted on the matter with the Imám-Jum'ih of Isfahán, who was the head of the clerical establishment, saying, 'These two brothers are Bahá'ís, and by the law of Islám must be put to death since they do not recognize His Holiness the Apostle as the Seal of the Prophets, and believe Mírzá Siyyid 'Alí-Muhammad-i-Shírází to be the author of a new Revelation. This apart, these two brothers are exceedingly wealthy, and if they be slain on the grounds of opposition to Islám, their fortune will revert unto us.' The Imám-Jum'ih accepted his proposal. These two reprobates now went to see Zillu's-Sultán, who was a prince, and the governor of Isfahán. The prince would not at first associate himself with their scheme, saying, 'Since these two brothers are not acting contrary to the interests of the state and the government, I cannot have them slain: unless ye should issue a fatvá decreeing that under the law of Islám they must be put to death -- then should I be able to take some measure.' Shaykh Báqir and the Imám-Jum'ih, together with seventeen other divines of the city, accordingly issued a fatvá decreeing that those two wronged ones should be put to death. At first they were thrown into prison. Their arrest provoked a strange uproar among the people, and even Europeans resident in Isfahán who were acquainted with the virtue and generosity of the two brothers were perturbed. Numerous telegrams were despatched to the Sháh in Tihrán, and he in turn telegraphed to the Zillu's-Sultán. His message, however, only reached the prince after the two brothers had been executed. Their throats were slit. A cord was then fastened to their feet, and their bodies were dragged through the thoroughfares and markets as far as the city gate. There they were cast beneath an earth wall, which was knocked down over them. When night fell, an old servant of the martyrs, who knew where their bodies lay, came and rescued them from beneath the wall. The impact of the collapse of the wall had crushed together those two pure temples. The old man washed from them the dust and blood with water from the Záyandih Rúd, and brought them to the cemetery. He dug two new graves, and there laid them to rest. The old man washed their two corses beside the Záyandih Rúd. The next morning servants of the prince, and soldiers in the area, noticed that the bodies had been removed from beneath the wall. A search was instituted for them, but to no avail, and thus the two bodies were preserved. However, as I mentioned, we cannot place a headstone over their grave; and even to visit the place we must perforce come in secret, for the Muslims are fiercely hostile, and should the matter come to their notice, such is their animosity towards us that they would utterly destroy the graves." "It was on account of these twin martyrs," he continued, "That this companion of ours (the grave-digger) became a believer in the Blessed Cause." "Is't not so?" he asked him; to which the old man replied, "Ay, truly, after the martyrdom of these two brothers I had a dream, in which I saw that a host of people had congregated in this graveyard, as though they had come to visit a particular site. Still in my dream I asked someone, 'Whose are these graves which the people are visiting?' 'These two graves,' I was told in reply, 'belong to the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs.' For this reason I became a believer in the Blessed Cause -- in this Cause whose followers, having recognized its Divine origin, attest its truth with their own blood. From that day forth, I have made it my endeavour to guard and protect these twin graves, and have placed upon them some simple marks lest their location should be forgotten." The vendor said, "This is a good man. Previously, when the friends came to visit these graves, he would take them to his home, and entertain them with tea and a narghile. His home lay in this same vicinity. When the Muslims realized what he was about, they destroyed his home, beat him, and smashed his tea utensils and narghile. He is a very poor man." Then he whispered to me, "Wert thou to bestow upon him a small bounty it would be a most fitting gesture." I made him a modest donation, whereupon he arose, and, expressing his thanks, departed. We remained seated there a while longer, and then set off on our way. I cast back a last glance at the two graves, and by way of a memorial picked up a little stone from each. We headed towards the city, and on the way saw again our grave-digger acquaintance, who was walking in company with his small son. When he noticed us, he once more expressed his thanks, saying, "I wish thee Godspeed!" I am deeply touched by these poor and loving people. When I shared a part of my thoughts with my companion, he replied, "It is even so. Ye Christians are much closer to us Bahá'ís than are the Muslims. Ye know that the Muslims consider you unclean. If any of them associate with you, it is in appearance only, for their religious fanaticism is intense. But we Bahá'ís are not so. We have been enjoined to regard all men as clean and pure, whatever their religion. In particular we harbour affection for you Christians. The tribulations borne by His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh, the Lawgiver of the Bahá'í Faith, Who is the return of Christ, are the selfsame sufferings borne by His Holiness Christ, the Founder of your religion. Their Holinesses Bahá'u'lláh and Christ were both possessed of Divine knowledge and wisdom. From childhood, the signs of greatness were evident in both. They were both averse to the reprehensible customs and habits prevalent in their societies. Such too was the case with His Holiness the Báb. Their Holinesses the Báb and Christ were both put to death by the sentence of the fanatical clergy, and by the order of the rulers of their age. ..."

*Edward Browne now turns to providing, on the authority of the Bahá'í vendor, an account of the blessed teachings; the progress of the Cause; the sacrifices of the friends; the month of fasting; and other matters, which it is not considered necessary here to translate.*

*Likewise, in the tenth chapter of this same book, he provides a detailed account of some notable events in Bahá'í history, amongst which, on the subject of the Twin Shining Lights, he states the following:*

... A few days later I went to meet my companion Mírzá 'Alí. Shortly after my arrival, Hájí Mírzá Hasan also made his appearance, and then for about three consecutive hours we discussed the Bahá'í religion. Our discussion was interrupted at a certain point by the arrival of a stranger. Hájj Mírzá Hasan then provided me with the following description of an encounter he had had with Bahá'u'lláh. He said, "Thou hast doubtless heard of the martyrs of Isfahán. A little ere their martyrdom, I was in 'Akká. Hájí Mírzá Hasan-'Alí, whom thou didst meet in Isfahán, and Áqá Siyyid Hádí were there also. One or two days before we left 'Akká for Írán, we were admitted into the presence of His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh. There was a garden there to which He sometimes repaired. On that day He was seated in this garden, and we too were standing in His blessed presence. He bade us be seated. When we had seated ourselves, He ordered tea to be brought for us. Whilst we were occupied in drinking tea, He observed, 'An important event is shortly about to befall.' That evening, Áqá Siyyid Hádí inquired in person of His Holiness where this great event would occur. He replied, 'In the Land of Sád.' Siyyid Hádí wrote to some of his friends in Írán informing them of the matter. When we arrived back in Írán, Hájj Mírzá Hasan-'Alí remained in Tihrán, while I continued my journey towards Isfahán. In Káshán I heard the news of the arrest of the Twin Shining Lights, but told myself, 'They are wealthy, and will inevitably be released.' I never imagined that Bahá'u'lláh's words could be an allusion to their martyrdom, and was convinced that the great event intended should be an outbreak of cholera, a famine, or an earthquake. Four or five days later, the news of their martyrdom reached me in Káshán. I decided not to continue my journey to Isfahán, and returned to Tihrán. I realized that the expression 'important event' was an allusion to their martyrdom. The Imám-Jum'ih, in pronouncing their death sentence, clapped his hand upon his throat, saying, 'If there be any crime in having these Bábís put to death, upon my neck be it.' A little while after their martyrdom, the Imám-Jum'ih fell into disgrace, and left Isfahán for Mashhad. It was not long before malignant tumours appeared in his throat and upon his neck, and he died of this same malady. A month after their martyrdom, a Blessed Tablet arrived from 'Akká containing dire warnings to Shaykh Báqir. Shortly after this the Shaykh journeyed to Karbilá, only to find, after his return to Isfahán, that his wife and daughter, who were beyond words beautiful and comely, had been borne off by the prince-governor to his own harem. This misfortune was followed swiftly by another; and, just as His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh had intimated in the Tablet He addressed to him, he died in the utmost humiliation, having derived not the slightest benefit from all the wealth and riches he had wrongfully amassed." Mírzá 'Alí affirmed that he had himself read the stated Tablet and taken a copy of it.

Specimen of the Handwriting of the King of Martyrs

*Facsimile of a letter from the King of Martyrs to a believer in the Holy Land concerning an order the latter had made for binding Tablets. The text of the letter is as follows: "May my soul be a sacrifice for thy love. I perused at the time of its arrival the amber-scented purest letter wherewith, (by the hand of) Áqá Muhammad-Husayn the courier, thou didst graciously honour and dignify this broken-winged one at the beginning of the month of Shavvál, and (rejoiced) exceedingly at the news it contained of the health of thy blessed temple; for the which I rendered thanks unto His Holiness the Adored One -- may my soul and the souls of all who are in the kingdoms of Revelation and Creation be His sacrifice. Since in thy letter thou hadst bidden me (await) some suitable means of communication, I have refrained from writing to thee until now, when Áqá Muhammad-Husayn hath (returned) from the Land of Bá' and Shín (Búshihr) with the intention of visiting Him Who is the Object of our adoration, and the trusts thou didst leave with me have by the grace of the True One been discharged. Although thou hadst ordered the Most Holy Divine Tablets to be arranged separately, it seemed in my humble opinion preferable and more fitting for them to be bound in a single volume. For this reason I requested Áqá Muhammad-Hádí the book-binder -- upon him be the Glory of God -- to arrange them in volumes, whence with the utmost care and diligence he hath produced two volumes, each containing Holy, Incomparable and Blessed Tablets to the number of Váhid. The numbers of Most Holy Tablets (for) thee one Tablet (...) become this servant (...) ... // I donated one Holy and Blessed Tablet to Áqá Muhammad-Hádí, that he might include it among thy Tablets, to the end that the volumes should be identical. Also accompanying the volumes (is) the Blessed Ode which, as thou hadst bidden, hath been gilded and bound. My hope is that all the completed work will meet with thine approval. As regards the expenses of the Holy and Incomparable Tablets and the Blessed Ode, since thou hadst ordered me to charge them to the account of Áqá 'Abdu'l-Husayn, I have, obedient to thine order, made out the (invoice of expenses) in the name of Áqá 'Abdu'l-Husayn -- upon whom be the Glory of God. Assuredly this will come to thine attention. (...) Do thou convey (...) the greetings of this evanescent one unto (...) blessed thine (esteemed father) -- upon him be the Glory of God -- and thy respected brothers -- upon them be the Glory of God -- and crave on my behalf their pardon for my not writing to each a (separate) letter. I await ever thine honoured communications, thy (seemly) commands, and tidings of thy physical well-being. Glory, (mercy) and splendour be upon you, and upon all the friends of God on the part of this evanescent one, the Name Há'. Dated the (third) of Safar 92"*

Specimen of the Handwriting of the Beloved of Martyrs

*Facsimile of a letter written by the Beloved of Martyrs to an unidentified recipient. So far as the text can be made out, it reads as follows: "May my soul, my essence and my being be a sacrifice for the dust of thy feet. After (...) I was completely unaware (of) thy having been indisposed in the manner thou didst describe in thy letter; otherwise I should have written to thee repeatedly. When Áqá (...) Muhammad-Hasan (in Yazd) wrote to say that thou hadst been ill of fever, and thy condition had improved, I (was) reassured that thou hadst made a full recovery. When last week I was honoured to receive thy letter, (...) I realized that thou hadst still not made a full recovery. This (abject) evanescent one too hath (from the beginning of the noble month of) Ramadán (until now) been afflicted by a severe pain in the side, and even after (many) purgative (treatments) the ailment hath still not been entirely cured. Although it is three years since the pain in the side of this servant (began, and still I have not found for it, nor is there, any cure...), I swear by His pure Branches that were He to vouchsafe to thy blessed being a full recovery from thine indisposition, I would accept that (whatever) residue of it remaineth should fall to the lot of this evanescent one. I swear by thy blessed head, that even in this frail condition I am nevertheless occupied both night and day responding to orders arriving from all quarters, and am thus absolutely unable to attend to other work. At least, in occupying myself with writing letters, I become to some degree diverted from attending to my poor health. At all events, (we resign ourselves to God, Who) is the source of grace and favours to all mankind, whilst shortcoming and failure proceed only from these sinful creatures. At all events, last week ... // ... I sent thee as enclosures in my letter (copies) of a number of Incomparable Tablets (...) -- may my soul be a sacrifice for the dust of His feet. God willing, thou wilt have seen them. (Copies) of two or three further Tablets were also sent to (Rahbar), to the end that he might forward (copies) of the same. This week too a (copy of a) Blessed Tablet that had been vouchsafed to the friends of Há' and Mím (Hamadán) arrived from the Land of Tá' (Tihrán). Should a scribe come to hand, this too will be forwarded. (Áqá Shaykh Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Qá'iní's present) arrived within thy blessed letter. His reply arrived this week (...) in a letter from Alexandria (dated ... of the year ...). I noted all the matters thou hadst set forth. Thou hadst written concerning conditions in that land. (The whole region is suffering) on account of the absence of rainfall. Some went forth from the city to pray for rain. That same night a strange earthquake took place. It is evident that the influence of malicious souls hath produced this effect. In this land too there hath been absolutely no rainfall. All the people have (become) disturbed and troubled. The governorship of Yazd too hath been bestowed upon his honour Zillu's-Sultán. (He is to have his way in Yazd.) Even as thou hast said, the signs of the wrath and anger of God have encompassed all. May the Lord keep His believing servants firm and steadfast in His Cause. Thou hadst inquired of Jináb-i-Amín. Having set off for (...), he is presently in Yazd. He was (...) in Tihrán. These days he will not be arriving in this land. This is told thee for thine information. Do thou kindly convey the greetings of this servant. (...) Glory of God (...). // ... and convey to the blessed womenfolk and the sons and (daughters...). (All) the children and the servant (...) present their (self-effacement and nothingness). (God willing) thou wilt gladden me with tidings of the improvement of thy blessed condition. The sacred month of Muharram 96. // (Prayer for healing) 'None shall be able to withstand the sovereign potency of His healing, neither in the heavens, nor in the earth, nor in whatsoever lieth between them. He, verily, is the Healer, the Curer, the Restorer.'"*

i.e. one whose letter had apparently been forwarded to Bahá'u'lláh by the "Muhammad" who is shortly to be addressed.*

The identity of the addressee is not at present known.*

i.e. Mullá Kázim-i-Tálkhúnchi'í, who was martyred in Isfahán one month before the Twin Shining Lights.

Mullá Husayn-i-Bushrú'í.

i.e. The Báb.

i.e. The Báb.

i.e. the King and the Beloved of Martyrs.

The Tablet from which this passage has been taken is given at length in Section Five below.

For a description of this event, see *The Dawn-Breakers*, pp. 208-9.

i.e. (since by the Persian convention age is reckoned from the *beginning*, not the *end*, of the year), they were respectively still only *ten* and *eight* years old; likewise all ages cited in Persian sources throughout this book must be understood as a year greater than they would be represented in the West.

Year commencing 23 March 1871 in the Gregorian calendar: the Great Persian Famine of 1870-1871.

In the first Tablet to Varqá quoted in Section Five below, Bahá'u'lláh says: "Wealth prevented them not from drawing nigh unto God, and worldly splendour withheld them not from laying down alike their substance and their life." (Cf. also Bahá'u'lláh's statement concerning the Twin Shining Lights on p. 72 of the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf: "Neither fortune, nor wealth, nor glory, could deter them!")*

In fact the author has included no poetry as such in this section, albeit the selected items do include the odd line of verse.*

A variant of "Abu'l-Fadl."

23 June 1958.

To be referred to henceforth by the abbreviation A.H.S. (*Anno Hegirae Solare*).

Zavárih is among the towns around Isfahán, and its inhabitants are for the most part Siyyids and descendants of the Prophet. The silver-tongued poets have bequeathed a number of exquisite utterances concerning Zavárih and its Siyyids, which are to be found in literary works. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

A designation of the Prophet Muhammad.

See Qur'án, 3.185, 21.35 & 29.57.

"Hind" being the designation of India in both Arabic and Persian.

In the treatise of her Holiness the Consort \sc. of 'Abdu'l-Bahá\ it is written that the subject had *two* sons, of whom the elder was Hájí Siyyid Mihdí. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

i.e. Najaf and Karbilá.

i.e. the "Canal-Builder."

Shaykh Ahmad Bin Zaynu'd-Dín-i-Ahsá'í was the chief and leader of Shaykhism, and the founder of that school. He died in 1242 A.H. \year commencing 5 August 1826\ between Mecca and Medina, and was buried in the Baqí' cemetery in Medina the Fragrant. A detailed account of him has been provided in *Nabíl's Narrative*, in Dih-Khudá's *Lughat-Námih*, and in the book *Rayhánatu'l-Adab* \mentioned shortly hereafter\, to which works reference should be made for further information. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

i.e. descended from the seventh Imám, Músá Kázim.

Siyyid Muhammad-Mihdíy-i-Tabátabá'íy-i-Burújirdí.

sc. in that same year; but cf. "Hájí Siyyid Muhammad-Báqir died before the year sixty A.H., the year that witnessed the birth of the Faith proclaimed by the Báb."---*The Dawn-Breakers*, p 23*

Presumably on account of this shared connection with the Shaykhí movement.

In His biographical account of Shamsu'd-Duhá in *Memorials of the Faithful* (see below) 'Abdu'l-Bahá says in this respect: "... since she and her husband were both strongly attracted to the mystical teachings of that great luminary, the excellent and distinguished Siyyid Kázim-i-Rashtí, they left for Karbilá, accompanied by Mírzá Hádí's brother, Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí."*

Hájí Siyyid Kázim is the son of Siyyid Qásim-i-Rashtí, and the successor of the late Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá'í. He passed away after sixty years of existence on the ninth day of Dhi'l-Hijjih, which is known as the Day of 'Arafih, in the year 1259 A.H. \31 December 1843\, and is buried in Karbilá in the precincts of the illumined resting-place of His Holiness the Prince of Martyrs. An account of him is provided in *Nabíl's Narrative* and the *Rayhánatu'l-Adab*, to which reference should be made. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

i.e. the Imám Husayn.

'Abdu'l-Bahá states however in the aforesaid account of Shamsu'd-Duhá in *Memorials of the Faithful* that Mírzá Hádí returned to Karbilá (though it was doubtless by way of Isfahán).*

Khurásán; see *The Dawn-Breakers*, p. 269: "In pursuance of the Divine decree, in the days when Quddús was still residing in Mashhad, there was revealed from the pen of the Báb a Tablet addressed to all the believers of Persia, in which every loyal adherent of the Faith was enjoined to 'hasten to the Land of Khá',' the province of Khurásán. The news of this high injunction spread with marvellous rapidity and aroused universal enthusiasm."

For an account of the Níyálá incident, see *The Dawn-Breakers*, pp. 298-300.

This section contains also (on the pattern of that following) an account of the *descendants* of the paternal uncles of the Twin Shining Lights.*

The Sultánu'l-'Ulamá \literally, "King of the 'Ulamá"\ is the same who was ordered by Manúchihr Khán, the Mu'tamidu'd-Dawlih \the governor of Isfahán\, to entertain the Báb in his home, and at whose request the Commentary on the Súrih of Va'l-'Asr was revealed. At first he was favourably disposed towards the Báb, but later, fearing lest his standing and authority should be diminished, he issued a fatvá declaring the Báb to be insane. He died in 1291 A.H. \year commencing 18 February 1874\ (Ishráq-Khávarí) For a description of the said evening reception, see *The Dawn-Breakers*, pp. 201-2.

Mír Muhammad-Husayn, by reason of the part he played in the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights, was afterwards styled the "She-Serpent" by the Pen of the All-Merciful in the Lawh-i-Burhán (Tablet of the Proof). (Ishráq-Khávarí)

He is stated on p. 100 of *The Dawn-Breakers* to be one of the few Siyyids of Isfahán who recognized the truth of the Cause. Listed on p. 422 as the 133^rd^ of 173 souls who fell in the siege of the fort of Shaykh Tabarsí, he is described as "a distinguished Siyyid and a highly esteemed divine, whose declared purpose to enlist under the banner of Mullá Husayn caused a great tumult among the 'ulamás of Isfahán."

Literally, "Hájí Muhammad the Merchant" (the aforesaid Hájí Áqá Muhammad).

A well-known cleric who was among the earliest converts to the Faith (see *The Dawn-Breakers*, p. 100, footnote), and who translated the Báb's Risáliy-i-Furú'-i-'Adlíyyih into Persian (see *God Passes By*, p. 24).

Year commencing 9 December 1847 in the Gregorian calendar.

Shaykh Salmán, the Courier of the All-Merciful, received many Tablets, and performed mighty services for the Cause. 'Abdu'l-Bahá included an account of him in *Memorials of the Faithful*. His children and grandchildren are still living, and under the shadow of the Cause. He was originally from Cham Khalaf-i-'Ísá, one of the villages around Hindíján in the region of Ahváz. He was named by his mother Shaykh Khanjar; but after he embraced the Blessed Cause he became known as Shaykh Salmán. His native village of Cham Khalaf-i-'Ísá near Hindíján, whose name survives to this day, is now known as Daríhak. He passed away in 1316 A.H. \year commencing 22 May 1898\, and his grave is in Shíráz. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

i.e., specifically, the port of Jaddih, from whence pilgrims proceed to Mecca.

Since Munírih Khánum was married to 'Abdu'l-Bahá in about 1873, it is assumed she may have travelled by way of the Suez Canal, which opened in 1869.*

For a brief account of how Munírih Khánum received her title, see *Munírih Khánum: Memoirs and Letters*, pp. 44-46; also pp. 24-25 for further relevant background information.*

She was known as 'Izzíyyih. She was very much opposed to the Cause of God, and a treatise was written in her name to refute it. The Tablet of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá to "'Ammih" (His paternal aunt), which is included in the second volume of *Makátíb*, is addressed to this same 'Izzíyyih. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

Former title of the Prime Minister, or Grand Vizir, who was at this time Mírzá Áqá Khán.

The "Great Lady."

See pp. 169-71.

A variant of Bahíyyih Khánum.

It may be noticed that the ode has 19 lines.

In fact 'Abdu'l-Bahá had a total of *nine* children, seven daughters and two sons, of whom only four daughters survived, the surviving Túbá having been predeceased by an older sister of the same name (between Mihdí and Fu'ádíyyih).*

i.e., according to the Western understanding, two or three years old.

i.e. the Diary of Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání: see Vol. 2, p. 149 of the Persian original *Badáyi'u'l-Áthár*.

i.e. the Persian equivalents of the English letters "M" and "B."

Meaning in Persian the act of gazing at a spectacle.

Because the child was always wishing to "have a look" at things, the word was often on his lips; and Bahá'u'lláh thus represents him as indulging this predilection to his heart's content in the world to come.

The author appears to have reversed the order of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's second and third surviving daughters.*

i.e. she married her second cousin.

sc. Áqá Mírzá Muhsin Afnán, son of Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Hasan, the "Afnán-i-Kabír," or "Great Afnán."

The son of Mírzá 'Abdu'r-Rahím-i-Yazdí.

Year commencing 21 March 1934: in fact, Munírih Khánum passed away in 1938.*

Probably a paragraph break is not necessary here.*

i.e. Isfahán, whose second letter in the Arabic script is "Sád," having a numerical value of 90.

As mentioned, the brother of Mír Muhammad-Husayn the "She-Serpent," who was present at the evening reception held by Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím in the Báb's honour in Isfahán.

Literally, "Noontide Sun."

The original is in Arabic.

i.e. the Báb.

The Báb was designated among other titles "Possessor of the Twin Names," (sc. 'Alí and Muhammad), whose significance, thus conjoined, resides partly in their designating the stations respectively of *Vicegerency* (identified with the Imám 'Alí) and *Prophecy* (identified with the Prophet Muhammad).

i.e. the people of Isfahán.

Still addressing Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí.

sc., as previously mentioned, to Khurásán, in conformity with Muslim Traditions in this regard.

sc. to avenge the death.

i.e. the Holy Sites in 'Iráq -- the same earlier designated by the author "Exalted Thresholds."

As mentioned above, 'Abdu'l-Bahá states in His biographical account of Shamsu'd-Duhá in *Memorials of the Faithful* (see below) that Áqá Mírzá Hádí and his wife Shamsu'd-Duhá, being strongly attracted to the mystical teachings of Siyyid Kázim, removed to Karbilá, together with the as yet unmarried Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí, in order to benefit from his knowledge and learning at first hand.*

In reference to the Muslim Traditions, which depict the Countenance of God as concealed by seventy thousand veils of light.

Reminiscent of Shaykh Hasan-i-Zunúzí's description, recorded in *The Dawn-Breakers*, of the impression made upon him by the Báb: "I watched Him \the Báb\ several times as He stood in an attitude of prayer at the doorway of the shrine of the Imám Husayn. So wrapt was He in His devotions that He seemed utterly oblivious of those around Him. ... those of the visiting pilgrims who were near enough to hear Him ... marvelled at the evidences of piety and veneration which that youthful countenance evinced. ... That Youth had set my heart aflame. ... My soul was wedded to His till the day when the call of a Youth from Shíráz, proclaiming Himself to be the Báb, reached my ears. The thought instantly flashed through my mind that such a person could be none other than that selfsame Youth whom I had seen in Karbilá, the Youth of my heart's desire."---p. 30

'Abdu'l-Bahá states however in the said account of Shamsu'd-Duhá in *Memorials of the Faithful* that Mírzá Hádí returned to Karbilá (though it was doubtless by way of Isfahán).*

31 December 1843.

For a full account of the passing of Siyyid Kázim, see *The Dawn-Breakers*, pp. 42-6.

A title bestowed upon her by Siyyid Kázim-i-Rashtí, signifying literally, "Solace of the Eyes."

i.e. that, among the seven divining arrows used in *maysir* (an ancient Arabian game of chance, subsequently forbidden in the Qur'án), to which attached the highest gain; used proverbially, as here, to denote superiority and success. The figure recurs in a Tablet quoted in Section Five.

'Abdu'l-Bahá states however in His account of Shamsu'd-Duhá in *Memorials of the Faithful* that Áqá Mírzá Hádí's arrival in Qazvín *preceded* that of his wife: "On his return, he awaited the arrival of Shamsu'd-Duhá in Qazvín, after which the couple left for Isfahán, and when they reached there, Mírzá Hádí journeyed on to Badasht."*

In fact, Quddús' life was saved by Bahá'u'lláh (see *The Dawn-Breakers*, pp. 299 & 376).

The same identified as "Mírzá 'Abdu'lláh" on p. 299 of *The Dawn-Breakers*.

The home town of Quddús.

"According to Samandar (p. 32), Shaykh Abú-Turáb was a native of Ishtihárd, and ranked among the leading disciples of Siyyid Kázim. He married the sister of Mullá Husayn. He died while in prison in Tihrán."---*The Dawn-Breakers*, p. 39, n. 1. It appears that the subject was known also as Shaykh Abú-Turáb-i-*Qazvíní*: see *The Dawn-Breakers*, p. 383, n. 1.*

Mírzá 'Ináyatu'lláh passed away in Tihrán on 12 Khurdád 1340 A.H.S. \2 June 1961\, corresponding to the fourth of the month of 'Azamat 118. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

See *Memorials of the Faithful*, pp. 173-5.

See *Memorials of the Faithful*, pp. 180-90.

A designation of the Báb: "*Rabb-i-A'lá*" in Persian.

From the foregoing accounts it is understood that, having initially missed the Báb in Shíráz, the two brothers succeeded, when they revisited that city after the Báb's return from pilgrimage, in coming into His presence; and that it was only then that they returned to their respective homes in Isfahán and Karbilá.*

The "Canal-Builder."

The opprobrious title given by Bahá'u'lláh to Mír Muhammad-Husayn, the Imám-Jum'ih of Isfahán, who instigated the death of the Twin Shining Lights.

The opprobrious title bestowed by Bahá'u'lláh, apparently with reference to the Qur'ánic story of Joseph, upon Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir, who pronounced the death sentence upon the Twin Shining Lights.

"O Thou Glory of the All-Glorious!" -- a form of the Greatest Name, and that which, in the famous calligraphic design of Mishkín-Qalam (see Section Two below), has become almost an insignia of the Bahá'í Faith.

The eighth Imám.

i.e. the passing of Bahá'u'lláh.

Year commencing 29 April 1835.

Not to be confused with Fátimih Begum, the daughter of Áqá Mírzá Hádíy-i-Nahrí, and wife of the King of Martyrs. Both the Beloved and King of Martyrs had wives named Fátimih.

The original of the first prayer is in Arabic, and of the second in Persian.

i.e. the Beloved of Martyrs.

i.e. after the death of the Beloved of Martyrs.

i.e. twenty-nine, according to the Western understanding.

i.e. before which he would not have entered into wedlock.

sc. in the Bahá'í Faith: this, and the concluding salutation of the Tablet, show that, despite the author's earlier statement that he was a Muslim, Áqá Mihdí Hájí Rasúl must have become a believer in the Cause some time between the martyrdom of the Beloved of Martyrs and the passing of his wife.*

i.e. Áqá Mihdí Hájí Rasúl had neither, before becoming a believer in the Cause, any expectation of such a bounty, nor, after the martyrdom of the Beloved of Martyrs, any realization that it had occurred.

The entire text of this Tablet, including address data, is given hereafter in Section Six.

It is not clear why, having left unmentioned the age of Fátimih Begum, the author should now list the sons of the Beloved of Martyrs *in reverse order of age*, especially since he follows the more usual approach when dealing with the offspring of the King of Martyrs below.*

Liqá'íyyih Khánum, the daughter of Zahrá Begum, daughter of Khadíjih Sultán Begum: Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí's first cousin once removed.

Jalál and 'Abdu'l-Husayn (see some way below in this same section).

See *Memorials of the Faithful*, pp. 73-5, and *The Dawn-Breakers*, pp. 159 & 292 (2x).

Title of the famed Bahá'í calligrapher Mírzá Husayn-i-Isfahání, signifying literally, "Musk-laden Pen."

sc. after his passing: in question are his second wife Túbá Khánum, and the children from that marriage.

i.e. Mishkín-Qalam and Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, as becomes apparent from the Tablet.

i.e., specifically, to Adrianople, in order to attain the presence of Bahá'u'lláh.

A reference to Mishkín-Qalam's incarceration at the hands of the Turkish authorities prior to his expulsion from Istanbul to Gallipoli: see *Memorials of the Faithful*, p. 100.

The Turkish seaport, commanding the entrance to the Straits of the Dardanelles, to which, together with His companions, Bahá'u'lláh was directed to proceed preparatory to His fourth and final exile.

i.e. Central Asia, the home of the Turks (cf. the following note on Kay-Khusraw).

Dúst-Muhammad Khán, the son of that same Dúst-'Alí Khán who had visited Bahá'u'lláh in the Síyáh-Chál: see Hasan Balyuzi, *Bahá'u'lláh: The King of Glory*, p. 79 and note.

i.e. Mishkín and Sádiq (the epithets are the same as those used at the outset of the Tablet).

One of the Kayanids; descended, through his mother Princess Farangís of Túrán, from Afrásíyáb, and, through his father Síyávash, from Kay-Kávús, who chose him as his heir on the throne of Írán.

13 April 1921.

Year commencing 9 July 1861.

18 June 1920.

The site of the city's former graveyard, and one of the foremost cemeteries in the Shí'ite World. Dating back to before the Muslim conquest in the seventh century, the cemetery is the resting-place of a number of famous figures, including (allegedly) the prophet Joshua, and Siyyid Abu'l-Qásim Mír-Findiriskí, who is referred to on p. 41 of the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf. Since 1363 A.H.S. (c. 1984) there have been no further burials in the cemetery, save in the case of victims of the Írán-'Iráq War; and it has now been replaced as the principal graveyard of the city by the "Bágh-i-Ridván" -- the "Ridván Garden."

15 September 1920: the identity of the recipient of the Tablet is not at present known, but is assumed under the circumstances to be a relation of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq.*

A farsang, also known as a parsang or parasang, is "the distance which a laden mule will walk in the hour, which varies from three to four miles."---*The Dawn-Breakers*, p. 674

i.e. the Imám 'Alí, the first rightful Caliph in the eyes of the Shí'ahs.

sc. the Prince of Martyrs.

i.e. they were Shí'ahs.

See Qur'án, 18.18.

i.e. the Prince of the Martyrs became ultimately so honoured, despite all the efforts exerted to consign Him to oblivion, and to erase every trace of Him from the world, that the greatest monarch of the Muslim world was in the end happy merely to be accounted a watchdog guarding the threshold to His shrine.

i.e. of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq and the martyrs of Isfahán.

See Qur'án, 6.91.

7 November 1920.

The recipient's name of Sádiq is alluded to at the outset of the Tablet by its root letters, somewhat in the manner of the "Disconnected Letters" of the Qur'án, which appear before many of its Súrihs.

The form of expression recalls the opening of the Qur'ánic Súrih of Maryam, which also begins with a series of Disconnected Letters ("Káf, Há', Yá', 'Ayn, Sád"), followed by the words "The memorial of the mercy of thy Lord unto His servant Zakaríyyá (Zacharias)."

A title of the Qur'án, signifying "Discrimination, Distinction."

i.e. the promise of attainment to the Divine presence on the Day of God.

sc. with God, as manifested in Bahá'u'lláh, on the Day of Judgment.

*Balmá'*: the night of the full moon.

See Qur'án, 17.79.

The language of the Tablet changes at this point from Arabic to Persian.

Presumably Hájí Abu'l-Hasan Amín-i-Ardikání, Hand of the Cause, Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh, and second Trustee of the Huqúqu'lláh.*

i.e. the Beloved and the King of Martyrs.

i.e. "are fortunate both to love you, and to enjoy your love in return."

i.e. Bahá' (Glory), whose numerical value in the Abjad system is 9.

sc. Noah's unbelieving son Canaan, who refused to enter the Ark.

See Qur'án, 11.46.

E. G. Browne, the notable Orientalist of Pembroke College, Cambridge, who left for posterity a rare pen-portrait of Bahá'u'lláh (1862-1926).

Perhaps the most famous Persian calligrapher, and a pre-eminent exponent of the Nasta'líq style, the "Pride of Islamic Scripts" (a blend of Naskh and Ta'líq), now widely favoured in Írán (1554-1615).

Mullá Ádí-Guzal: "According to the '*Kashfu'l-Ghitá'*' (p. 241) his full name was Mírzá 'Alíy-i-Sayyáh-i-Marághi'í. He had acted as the servant of the Báb in Máh-Kú, ranked among His leading companions, and subsequently embraced the Message of Bahá'u'lláh." (*The Dawn-Breakers*, p. 431, Note 3)

i.e. 1285-94 A.H., corresponding to the years commencing 24 April 1868 and 16 January 1877.

The author's narrative resumes here.

Year commencing 16 January 1812.

The "Antique-Dealer."

sc. as addressees, along with their mother Túbá Khánum, of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablet, dated 4 Sha'bán 1339 (13 April 1921), to the survivors of the late Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq.

Násiri'd-Dín Sháh. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

i.e. "Heir to the throne:" the future Muzaffari'd-Dín Sháh.

i.e., presumably, Hájí Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Nahrí, the "Canal-builder," whose great-grandson, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, was destined, in a subsequent epoch, to be joined in wedlock to the calligrapher's grand-daughter, Túbá Khánum.*

The "Antique-Dealer." In fact the author had really only mentioned the *circumstance* of the marriage, not the manner in which it had come about: "The result of this union was a daughter, Sháh Begum, who was later joined in wedlock to a merchant named Áqá Mírzá Javád, known as Ántík-Furúsh, the son of Mírzá Abu'l-Hasan-i-Tájir."*

A position, in other words, similar to that occupied by Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím-i-Nahrí, father of the King and the Beloved of Martyrs (see the postscript to the biographical account of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, his children and grandchildren, in Section One above).

i.e. of Mishkín-Qalam, Ághá Begum.

i.e. Áqá Mírzá Javád himself.

*Bandiy-i-Báb-i-Bahá', Mishkín-Qalam*; see also the extract from E. G. Browne's *A Year Amongst the Persians* in Section Nine below.

i.e. during the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the Centre of the Covenant.

"*Bandiy-i-'Abdu'l-Bahá'*": i.e. "The Servant of the Servant of Bahá'."

Literally, "Imám-born:" the descendant of an Imám, or, as here, his shrine, forming a place of pilgrimage (*zíyárat*).

The transference of Mishkín-Qalam's family to the Holy Land is described in Húshang Guhar-Ríz's *Haváríyyún-i-Hadrat-i-Bahá'u'lláh* ("The Apostles of Bahá'u'lláh") as follows: "Mishkín-Qalam, who had travelled to Baghdád without the knowledge of his wife and children, had by now had no word of them for nearly twenty years. However diligently that respected family had searched for him, they had come across no trace of him. The Royal Court too had directed that his picture be posted on all gateways to the city, so that whoever had any clue as to his whereabouts should inform the government. // After a long while, the King and the Beloved of Martyrs became aware, from seeing him photographed in the vicinity of the Bahá'í Holy Places, that Mishkín-Qalam was resident in the Holy Land. Mírzá Haydar-'Alí happened to be visiting Isfahán at this time, and after he had contacted the family, spoken with them and conveyed to them tidings of the Blessed Cause, the whole family embraced its truth, and attained the honour of believing in its message. Pursuant to directions, that respected family, with the assistance of their honours the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, now set out for 'Akká. // Uninformed of this development, Mishkín-Qalam, intoxicated with the wine of reunion, was, by his sweet discourse and witticisms, engaged both night and day in brightening the lives of the Holy Family, when all at once he was confronted by the arrival of his wife and children. // The wife of Mishkín-Qalam was accorded the honour of sewing the vestments of the Most Holy Abhá Beauty, on account of which God-given bestowal her heart was filled with gratitude, and feelings of Divine contentment welled up from her very soul."---p. 148

Year commencing 23 January 1909.

i.e., presumably, as mentioned, Hájí Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Nahrí.*

*The Delight of Hearts*: the author's autobiographical memoir, an abridged version of which in English has been produced by the Hand of the Cause A. Q. Faizi.

*The Proofs Inculcating Recognition of the Truth*: a work of Bahá'í apologetics.

Year commencing 18 April 1836.

Month commencing 19 January 1942.

i.e. the Bahá'í Cemetery of Tihrán.

Year commencing 18 April 1836.

He married 'Abdu'l-Bahá's third daughter Rúhá Khánum.

In fact the author had there mentioned only the bare fact of the marriage.*

In other words, she married her first cousin once removed.

sc., presumably, *after* their apprehension; i.e. the *sixth* successive day of confinement.*

The túmán was until 1932 the official currency of Írán, equivalent to 10 ríyáls.

According to the Muslim tradition it was Ismá'íl (Ishmael) rather than Isháq (Isaac) whom Abraham was commanded to offer up as a sacrifice.

The Arabic word used in the original here (*yattaqí*) carries with it the implication that he resorted to the practice of *taqíyyih*, or dissimulation of his faith.

i.e. he made a spoken, rather than a written, final testament of faith (cf. the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Paragraph 109 -- the verb here represented as "to pronounce \one's\ confession" is the same as has there been rendered "to bear witness \unto").

i.e., possibly, 'Abdu'l-Bahá Himself, considering that, as the Son of Bahá'u'lláh, He was in a sense the "Remnant" of One Whose advent represents the fulfilment of the promised appearance of God on the Last Day in His guise of the Most Merciful (Rahmán): "By Him Who is the Great Announcement! The All-Merciful is come invested with undoubted sovereignty."---*Gleanings*, Selection XVII, p. 40. 'Abdu'l-Bahá's affirmation may thus be regarded as effectively, and *mercifully*, taking the place of the written confession of faith enjoined in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The word "Remnant" ("*Bid'at*"), it may be noted, is applied to descendants of the Prophet, as in the title "*Bid'atu'r-Rasúl*" ("The Remnant of the Prophet"), which is a designation of His daughter Fátimih, and has also, significantly, been used in Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet of the Proof (see Section Eight below) in reference to the Twin Shining Lights: "Thou hast torn in pieces a remnant of the Prophet Himself, and imagined that thou hadst helped the Faith of God."*

That is, the Sultánu'l-'Ulamá, the brother of Mír Muhammad-Husayn the "She-Serpent."

i.e. Mír Muhammad-Husayn the "She-Serpent," and Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir the "Wolf."

Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, known as Áqá Mírzá Áqá, Núri'd-Dín, the third Afnán to accept the Báb.

The Tablet from which this passage has been taken is given at length in Section Five below.

The Tablet is revealed in the voice of Mírzá Áqá Ján, the amanuensis of Bahá'u'lláh -- the "servant in attendance (*khádim*)" as he is styled -- to whom it has been dictated.

sc. of Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl.

sc. to Bahá'u'lláh.

i.e. Bahá'u'lláh.

sc. to Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl.

In fact the following circumstances have not ere now been alluded to by the author.*

sc. the prospect of her becoming his life's partner.

i.e. Munírih Khánum to be.

According to Munírih Khánum's own account, as recorded in *Munírih Khánum: Memoirs and Letters* (pp. 22-24), Áqá Mírzá Kázim, "a most dignified, loving, pleasant, and attractive person," who "would bring all the news from Adrianople, from the Presence of the Beloved, to Isfahán," had originally been destined as her husband, but, being taken ill on his wedding night, was unable to consummate the marriage, and passed away a few days later. "This story is related," she concludes, "so that if in the world of being difficulties and trials encompass a person, then he should know that behind the mystic veil there is a wisdom concealed. In reality that youth was an escort who delivered me to my true goal and ultimate destination. He it was who joined this drop to the Most Mighty Ocean." It would not indeed seem consistent with the ideals of the Cause, or with the Master's rôle as Perfect Exemplar, that His marriage should have been attended by such a consequence as that intimated in the present account.*

"The Graveside of the Cleric:" a cemetery in Isfahán named after Mír Siyyid Muhammad, the Imám-Jum'ih, the Sultánu'l-'Ulamá. For further information on the subject, see Section Eight below.

In other words, she wed her first cousin once removed.

In fact the author had mentioned previously only that Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí was later joined in wedlock to one of the grand-daughters of the sister of the King of Martyrs.*

i.e. another of the children of *Zahrá Begum*, the sister of Liqá'íyyih.

It seems possible that this Tal'at may be the lady of that same name, described as "not wholly convinced of the truth of the Cause," who married Mírzá Ahmad, second son of the Beloved of Martyrs, especially considering that her cousin Liqá'íyyih married his younger brother, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí.*

Literally, "not recognized thy *praise* (*thaná'*):" i.e. *worthiness* of the praise expressed in this Visitation Tablet -- none other but the "first praise (*thaná'*) that emanated from the Tongue of Majesty and Grandeur."

Literally, "they paid all his *havalihs*:" i.e. they financed the various payments which he made by *haválih* -- a form of money transfer -- to different parties.

The same who seems to have become a believer in the Cause some time between the martyrdom of the Beloved of Martyrs and the passing of his wife.

A loose rendering of Qur'án, 6.112, which reads in Sale's translation: "Thus have we appointed unto every prophet an enemy; the devils of men, and of genii: *who privately suggest the one to the other specious discourses to deceive:* but if thy LORD pleased, they would not have done it. Therefore leave them, and that which they have falsely imagined; ..."

The Prophet's Birthday is celebrated by the Sunnís on 12 Rabí'u'l-Avval, and by the Shí'ís on 17 of that same month, a date which coincides also with the birthday of the sixth Imám, Ja'far-i-Sádiq.

i.e. descendants of Fátimih, daughter of the Prophet, and wife of the first Imám 'Alí Ibn-i-Abí-Tálib.

Not to be confused either with the aforesaid Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Mudarris-i-Tabrízí, author of the *Rayhánatu'l-Adab*, or with Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir the "Wolf."

i.e. Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir and the Imám-Jum'ih, Mír Muhammad-Husayn.

i.e. to renounce his faith by cursing and execrating it, since a mere denial, as by declaring "I am not a Bahá'í" -- a course that was in fact offered to the martyrs -- would not have been deemed sufficient.

i.e., presumably, *inclusively* of that on which they were apprehended.*

Effectively a rallying call to the believers to spring to its defence.

17 March 1879.

The outstanding Bahá'í poet Áqá Mírzá 'Alí-Ashraf, known as 'Andalíb ("Nightingale"), who was born in the tea-producing city of Láhíján, Gílán, in 1270 A.H. (c. 1854), and died in Shíráz in 1335 A.H. (1917).

For this latter, see the first item quoted in Section Nine of this book.

As becomes apparent from later passages in this book, and is confirmed in *God Passes By* (p. 201), they were decapitated (and more precisely, it would seem, had their throats slit), thereby suffering the same fate as the Prince of Martyrs of the Islamic Dispensation, the Imám Husayn.

The eminent Bahá'í poet Na'ím-i-Sidihí, who was born in the village of Sidih near Isfahán (now Khumayní-Shahr) in 1272 A.H. (c. 1856), and died in Tihrán in 1334 A.H. (c. 1916).

The Maydán-i-Naqsh-i-Jihán ("Picture of the World Square"), a huge sports and exhibition ground laid out by Sháh 'Abbás I in the Naqsh-i-Jihán Gardens, and surrounded on all sides by magnificent edifices, such as the Masjid-i-Sháh; known previously also as the Maydán-i-Sháh, and now as the Maydán-i-Imám.

i.e. after completion of the designated period for crucifixion in Islamic law.

i.e., presumably, the *sixth* day after their apprehension.*

The "Son of the Wolf," the addressee of Bahá'u'lláh's Epistle by that name.

Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir the "Wolf."

i.e. as though he were a butcher about to set to the slaughter.

"Their richly-furnished houses were plundered, even to the trees and flowers in their gardens, all their remaining possessions were confiscated; ..."---*God Passes By*, p. 201

i.e. he was forty-four according to the Persian conception, forty-three according to the Western, while his brother by the latter reckoning was forty-four.

"Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir, denounced by Bahá'u'lláh as the 'wolf,' pronounced their death-sentence; the Zillu's-Sultán ratified the decision, after which they were put in chains, decapitated, dragged to the Maydán-i-Sháh, and there exposed to the indignities heaped upon them by a degraded and rapacious populace."---*God Passes By*, p. 201

sc. giving order for the victim's execution: it was 'Umar Ibn-i-Sa'd, a deputy of 'Ubaydu'lláh, the governor of Kúfih at the time of the Battle of Karbilá, who gave the order for the death of Husayn. The actual perpetrator of the deed, which was accomplished by beheading, was Shimr Ibn-i-Dhi'l-Jawshan.

The Tablet from which this, and the extract in the next-but-one following paragraph, have been taken is given at length in Section Five below (where however they are identified as originating from a Tablet addressed to Hakím Áqá Ján Tabíb-i-Hamadání).*

Zíyád Ibn-i-Abí-Sufyan, an Umayyad general and administrator notorious for his harshness.

"... Mír Muhammad-Husayn, surnamed the 'She-Serpent,' whom Bahá'u'lláh described as one 'infinitely more wicked than the oppressor of Karbilá,' ...."---*God Passes By*, pp. 232-233. As mentioned, it was not 'Ubaydu'lláh, but his deputy, who gave the command for Husayn to be martyred -- as indeed seems to be intimated by the foregoing extract -- and the text should probably be modified accordingly.*

The following words in fact there immediately *precede* the extract just quoted.*

i.e. innumerable souls have perished on account of the Divine retribution entailed by these grievous transgressions. By the same principle the Great Persian Famine of 1870-1871 (shortly to be referred to in the text), is attributed in the Bahá'í Writings to Divine retribution for the death of Badí'.

Alluding to the statement to that effect in the famous "Throne Verse" of the Qur'án, 2.255.

The Great Persian Famine of 1870-1871.

"Mention should, moreover, be made of the devastating famine which, about a year after the illustrious Badí' had been tortured to death, ravaged Persia and reduced the population to such extremities that even the rich went hungry, and hundreds of mothers ghoulishly devoured their own children."---*God Passes By*, p.233

His major apologetic work, signifying literally "Union Pearls," written in defence of the Kitáb-i-Íqán.

Presumably from the Armenian community, for whom the quarter had originally been constructed.*

The maiden's reaction is reminiscent of the remarks made by the envoy of the King of the Greeks to the Caliph Yazíd on the occasion of the martyrdom of the Imám Husayn.

"'In such wise,' Abdu'l-Bahá has written, 'was the blood of these two brothers shed that the Christian priest of Julfá cried out, lamented and wept on that day.'"---*God Passes By*, p.201

4 Shahrívar 1317, corresponding to 26 August 1938.

Excepting Qamar Khánum, the heirs are all children of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, whose names were mentioned at the beginning of the above-quoted Tablet revealed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá "in honour of the consort of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq and her children." Husayn and Hasan's surname of "Mahbúbí" derives from their grandfather's title of "Beloved of Martyrs" -- which is in Arabic "*Mahbúbu'sh-Shuhadá'*"

These latter words added in the margin of the letter in the Guardian's own hand.

The major river passing through Isfahán, whose name signifies literally, "life-giving" or "giving birth."

In the book *Khátirát-i-Muhájirí az Isfahán* ("Reminiscences of a Pioneer from Isfahán") Áqá Husayn-'Alí Núr is quoted as stating that the caravan was impounded one farsang outside the city (p. 17).*

Former designation of a military rank equivalent to Major-General.

A township 135 kilometres to the west of Isfahán, with a large Caucasian population.

i.e. the provincial levies, each of whose units was designated a "Fawj" ("Regiment"); e.g. the "Fawj-i-Aráminih," the "Armenian Regiment." Ja'far-Qulí Khán was Mír-Panj of the Fawj of Firaydan.

Chihil Sutún ("Forty Pillars") was built by Sháh 'Abbás II between 1646-48 as part of the palace complex initiated by Sháh 'Abbás I in the region of the aforesaid Naqsh-i-Jihán Square, and replaced the Tálár-i-Tavílih (see the first extract in Section Nine below) as the monarch's principal audience hall. It was supposedly so named because of the reflections created by its twenty pillars in a pool of water.

"His accomplice, Mír Muhammad-Husayn, surnamed the 'She-Serpent,' whom Bahá'u'lláh described as one 'infinitely more wicked than the oppressor of Karbilá,' was, about that same time, expelled from Isfahán, wandered from village to village, contracted a disease that engendered so foul an odour that even his wife and daughter could not bear to approach him, and died in such ill-favour with the local authorities that no one dared to attend his funeral, his corpse being ignominiously interred by a few porters."---*God Passes By*, pp. 232-233

i.e. he died, returning to that place which his deeds had made his natural dwelling in the life to come.

i.e. dissimulation of one's faith as a means of escaping persecution. Colonel 'Ináyatu'lláh-i-Suhráb here bluntly states what had been more delicately treated of in the foregoing account of Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl.

Referred to in Section Two above as "Mírzá Taqí."

Referred to in Section Two above as "Mírzá Muhammad-Shafí'-i-Khú'í."

i.e. of the notebook of Colonel 'Ináyatu'lláh-i-Suhráb's reminiscences, not of the present volume.*

Mírzá 'Alí-Akbar Khán-i-Dávar, who was prominent during the period of Ridá Sháh.

i.e. the period of Qájár rule, before the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905-11.

A colloquial pronunciation of "Siyyid *Ján*," meaning "*Dear* Siyyid," or "Siyyid *Love*."

Year commencing 30 November 1913.

Presumably the same encounter to which 'Abdu'l-Bahá refers in His account of Shamsu'd-Duhá.*

It goes without saying that Zillu's-Sultán was directly involved in the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights; as for why he spoke in this manner before His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, it was in order to exonerate himself in His sacred presence, imagining that by such falsehoods he could represent himself as innocent, heedless that the One True God has knowledge of all realities and matters. (Ishráq-Khávarí) Against this assertion, however, must be represented that 'Abdu'l-Bahá, in His account of the martyrdom of the King and the Beloved of Martyrs cited in Section One above, states: "Then the Sháh joined forces with those two wild animals \the Wolf and the She-Serpent\; and he commanded that the blood of both brothers, the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, be spilled out." In fact, according to this account, it was precisely the *Sháh* who caused the original sentence (which 'Abdu'l-Bahá says had been pronounced only against the King of Martyrs), to be broadened to include the Beloved of Martyrs as well.*

i.e., presumably, instructing the prince to transfer them from ecclesiastical to civil custody.*

sc. "other than to put you to death."

i.e., presumably, the Tálár-i-Tavílih, mentioned in Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl's account in Section Nine below.*

Zillu's-Sultán here refers to his father familiarly as "Daddy Sháh."

The author here likens the Twin Shining Lights to "Al-Hasanayn," or the "Two Hasans:" namely, Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, the sons of Fátimih and the Imám 'Alí, respectively the second and third Imáms.

The invocation is such as in Shí'ite Muslim usage customarily accompanies mention of the Imáms.

Agreeably with a figure frequently encountered in the Bahá'í Holy Writings, 'Abdu'l-Bahá here equivocates upon the addressee's given name of Sádiq, signifying "truthful," "sincere," and the like.

i.e. a euphemism for the former dwelling-place of the Twin Shining Lights.

i.e. prudence and discretion.

Year commencing 22 March 1943.

Her services in Írán are encapsulated in the following extract from *God Passes By*: "Many and diverse forces combined now to urge the American Bahá'í community to strong action: ... the tenacity and self-sacrifice of the fearless and brilliant Keith Ransom-Kehler, the first American martyr, who, journeying to Persia had pleaded in numerous interviews with ministers, ecclesiastics and government officials the cause of her down-trodden brethren in that land, had addressed no less than seven petitions to the Sháh, and, heedless of the warnings of age and ill-health, had at last succumbed in Isfahán."---p. 398

6 October 1932.

i.e., presumably, in the portion of that cemetery reserved for Bahá'í burials.*

"After more than a year of intense teaching work in Persia, ... our precious Keith left this world under so tragic circumstances that she was given by the Guardian the title of the first western martyr on Persian soil, and was raised by him to the station of one of the Hands of the Cause."---Letter on behalf of the Guardian dated 26 November 1933, published in *Dawn of a New Day*, pp. 45-46. A fuller account of her life may be found in Barron Harper's monograph on the Hands of the Cause, *Lights of Fortitude*.

i.e. the same daughter of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, son of the Beloved of Martyrs, who has been mentioned in the foregoing.

6 June 1933.

The name and identity of the recipient of the Tablet are not at present known. Note that a different version of this Visitation Tablet, which includes two preceding paragraphs, but closes with the petition for fulfilment of needs occurring after the first paragraph of this present version, is given in Section Five below. Both versions should be carefully checked against a reliable copy.*

i.e. the actual graves themselves (for the original expression might be taken in a metaphorical sense).

In order to visit the martyrs' resting-place in a large cemetery such as Takhtih-Fúlád, it would be necessary first to *know* generally in what quarter it was situated; having ascertained this, to *find* it amidst a host of other graves; and finally to thread one's way between them in order to *come before* it.

The opening passage of the Visitation Tablet appears in fact to be addressed to the whole company of the martyrs of Isfahán, who are then addressed separately in subsequent passages of the Tablet.*

See Qur'án, 2.156.

The visitant is here given the opportunity to beseech the fulfilment of some personal need.

Apparently the King of Martyrs, in view of the subject's characterization as "dayspring of fidelity," a quality with which the King of Martyrs is associated later in the Tablet, as well as in other Tablets.*

i.e. Mullá Kázim-i-Tálkhúnchi'í, who was martyred in Isfahán on 20 Safar 1296 A.H. (13 February 1879), a month before the King and the Beloved of Martyrs: "In Isfahán Mullá Kázim was beheaded by order of Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir, and a horse made to gallop over his corpse, which was then delivered to the flames, while Siyyid Áqá Ján had his ears cut off, and was led by a halter through the streets and bazaars."---*God Passes By*, p. 200. An account of his martyrdom is provided in Section Seven below.

i.e., presumably, Bahjí, whither Bahá'u'lláh moved from Mazra'ih in September 1879.*

Apparently the Beloved of Martyrs, in view of the subsequent reference to his namesake, the Imám Husayn.*

i.e. Fátimih, mother of the Hasanayn, as also of the Twin Shining Lights, considered as their "return."

Like Fátimih, the holy forbear of the Twin Shining Lights.

sc. , presumably, at the dawn of time, when God voiced to all the descendants of Adam the Call "Am I not your Lord;" and, receiving from them the answer "Yea!," thereby covenanted with them to recognize His Messengers, and to obey the laws and precepts they instituted on His part (see Qur'án 7.172).*

Apparently the King of Martyrs, in view of the immediately following reference to "king."*

i.e. Hasan and Husayn, whom Bahá'u'lláh (harking back surely to the "Hasanayn," or "Two Hasans," of Islám, the similarly named sons of Fátimih) seems here almost to have merged into a single person. (Fádil-i-Mázindarání in his account of the Twin Shining Lights in Section Nine below explicitly states: "They were named after their holy Ancestor's two martyred grandsons, Hasan and Husayn, ...")*

Presumably the King of Martyrs, again in view of the following reference to "fidelity." But the concluding passage could perhaps be taken to refer equally to both of Bahá'u'lláh's "Names Há'."*

sc. in response to His primordial Call, figuratively repeated down the ages by each successive Manifestation, and voiced most recently by the tongue of Bahá'u'lláh, "Am I not your Lord?"

To sum up, the Visitation Tablet appears to comprise separate sections addressed to: the martyrs of Isfahán in general (followed by the entreaty for fulfilment of needs); Hasan and his brother Husayn, in that order; Mullá Kázim; Husayn; Hasan; Hasan and Husayn without distinction; Hasan. Thus construed, the Tablet both begins and ends with passages addressed to Hasan, extolled for his fidelity.*

i.e. Hasan, Husayn and Kázim.

Cf. Qur'án, 77.10.

Note that the following Visitation Tablet has been excerpted from a much larger Tablet, included in *Áthár-i-Qalam-i-A'lá*, Vol. II, pp. 76-101 (pp. 91-94). Since the text there differs in some important respects from that provided in *Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn*, the latter should be subjected to careful scrutiny.*

It is not at present known for whom this Tablet of Visitation was revealed.*

"The hamstringing of the She-Camel goes back to Qur'án 7:71; 11.67; 54: 27, etc. The She-Camel was a sign of God, the proof of the Prophet Sálih's mission. The reference ... is to an act of blasphemy."---Marzieh Gail, Introduction to the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. xv.

"Will (*Mashíyyat* ) ... Purpose (*Irádat*) ... Destiny (*Qadar*)": reference to a Muslim Tradition, often cited in the Bahá'í Writings, which states: "Naught existeth in the heavens or on the earth save on account of seven: Will, Purpose, Decree, Destiny (*Qadá'*), Permission (*Idhn*), Term (*Ajal* ), Book (*Kitáb*)."

It is hard to determine whether this closing salutation forms part of the actual Visitation Prayer, or belongs rather to the surrounding Tablet addressed to the unidentified "friends."*

The signature is followed in other versions of the Tablet by the date 2 August 1919.*

The Tablet contains no direct indication that it is addressed to the Beloved of Martyrs: the appellation "Name of God," as distinct from "My Name Há'," might indeed suggest that it is addressed rather to the subsequently mentioned Khalíl. (Cf. for example the following directions at the beginning of a Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Bahá quoted on p. 57 of Dr. Dhabíhu'lláh 'Azízí's *Táj-i-Vahhá*j: "Tihrán. By the hand of the son of his honour the *Name of God*, Ustád 'Azíz, scion of the august *Khalíl*, upon him be the Glory of God ")*

The referent of the name is not at present known. It could be, for example: i) the Beloved of Martyrs himself, in view of his being destined, like Abraham, the Friend of God (Khalíl) to be cast as it were into a pit of fire; ii) his father, whose given name was Ibráhím, the Arabic form of Abraham (especially considering that, as the author states in Section One, he received numerous Tablets from Bahá'u'lláh); or iii) one of the other believers, such as the famous Bahá'í teacher, Muhammad-Ibráhím-i-Qazvíní.*

The figure of shattering idols is suggested by the Qur'ánic story of Ibráhím.

i.e. like His prototype Joseph.

From here until its closing salutation, the Tablet is addressed in general to "the people."

i.e., presumably, "Husayn," meaning Bahá'u'lláh. A modified version of this final formula ("Revealed a second time from the Kingdom of the Most Glorious") is associated in *La'áli'u'l-Hikmah*, Vol. I, p. 28, not with this but with the *next* Tablet, *which is the next in "Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn" too*.*

Cf. the somewhat similar statement near the beginning of Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet to Napoleon III: "Give ear, O King, unto the Voice that calleth from the Fire which burneth in this verdant Tree, on this Sinai which hath been raised above the hallowed and snow-white Spot, beyond the Everlasting City; 'Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful!'"

i.e. the Báb spoke the following words to Bahá'u'lláh in the spirit world while the Latter was in 'Akká. The expression "Mystery of God" ("*Sirru'lláh*") is of frequent occurrence in the Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'.

i.e. Himself, considering that the Báb is the Self of Bahá'u'lláh: "He is My Self, and I am His Self," Bahá'u'lláh quotes the Báb as saying at one point in the Kitáb-i-Badí' (p. 141; see also p. 206).

This passage might almost seem to have been addressed to Fath-'Alí Khán, a resident of nearby Ardistán, upon whom Bahá'u'lláh bestowed the title of "Fathu'l-A'zam" ("Most Great Victory").*

The main verb of the sentence, "*fa'ftah*," could be an allusion to the title "Fathu'l-A'zam."*

Isfahán.

Since the formula at the end of the preceding Tablet seems properly to belong to this, it is possible that these words too may, in the source whence they were extracted, belong to the *following* Tablet -- and with all the greater reason because of the possibility that the Tablet was addressed to Mírzá Fath-'Alí.*

Identified, by the invocation "Yá Hasan!" at the end of the Tablet, as the King of Martyrs. His special association in this opening invocation with the quality of fidelity tends also to corroborate that it is he who is intended by the invocation "O thou King of Fidelity!" in the foregoing Tablet of Visitation.*

Such alternation between grammatical numbers is typical of the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh.

The sentence looks forward to the series of counsels presented in what now follows.

That is, seven counsels all told.

i.e. and in particular the "counsels of eternity" presented in the preceding.

A term found in the Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'.

i.e. "revealed from 'Bá' Há' (the first two letters of 'Bahá''), O Hasan!"

The profoundly mystical tenor of this Tablet, as well as its final address "coding" (which seems to spell the name "Husayn" rather than "Hasan"), suggest that it may in fact have been revealed for the Beloved of Martyrs, who is characterized in a later Tablet as "Husayn of the domain of mystic meanings."*

i.e. he embarked upon a spiritual journey culminating in, as it had originated from, Bahá'u'lláh. The statement draws attention to the identity of the Manifestation with the Godhead, as also to the essential unity of the Manifestations of God throughout the ages when viewed in the light of this principle.

Sic in the original; but the wording may well be incorrect, and should be verified in a reliable text.*

i.e. phoenix.

The referent of the relative pronoun is "Thou" (hence "singest" is the correct verb form).

"Greetings and salutation rest upon this mansion which increaseth in splendour through the passage of time. Manifold wonders and marvels are found therein, and pens are baffled in attempting to describe them."---Inscription over the doorway of the Mansion of Bahjí, cited in *The Revelation of Bahá\'u\'lláh,* Adib Taherzadeh, Vol. 4, p. 104:

Nine attributes in all.

i.e. "Bá' Há' Alif", whose numerical values in Arabic are respectively 2, 5 and 1: "Bahá."

The whole address code, then, may be interpreted to signify: "From Bahá', for Husayn in Isfahán."

sc. *without permission*. In one of His Tablets Bahá'u'lláh states that of the three prerequisites of pilgrimage -- namely, means, health and permission -- the latter is the most important.

i.e. Tabríz.

Possibly an allusion to the incident referred to by H. M. Balyuzi in *Eminent Bahá'ís*, p. 79.*

i.e. who voice utterances calculated to foment discord rather than to promote harmony.

i.e. Isfahán.

The whole address code may be interpreted to signify: "From Bahá', for Hasan in Isfahán."

The first two letters of the name "Hasan" (as indeed of "Husayn" also).

It seems that a different visit may here be in question from that which the two brothers, in company with their paternal uncle Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alíy-i-Nahrí, made to Bahá'u'lláh while He was resident in Baghdád, for it is not clear whether He would have referred to Himself in such terms ere the Declaration of His Mission; and in any case a journey to Baghdád from Írán would not involve crossing any seas.*

i.e. this utterance is guaranteed to survive in the world throughout all ages: "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever."---Isaiah, 40:8

i.e. they should combine wisdom of conduct with eloquence of exposition.

i.e. *receive* them all (for the delivery of outgoing Tablets, which was accomplished by private couriers such as the aforementioned Salmán, was by no means assured).

i.e. undo its effect, or cause it to appear in any other guise than service.

"Consort ye then with the followers of all religions, and proclaim ye the Cause of your Lord, the Most Compassionate; this is the very crown of deeds, if ye be of them who understand."---Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Paragraph 75; "Say: Teach ye the Cause of God, O people of Bahá, for God hath prescribed unto every one the duty of proclaiming His Message, and regardeth it as the most meritorious of all deeds ... He hath, moreover, ordained that His Cause be taught through the power of men's utterance, and not through resort to violence. Thus hath His ordinance been sent down from the Kingdom of Him Who is the Most Exalted, the All-Wise."---*Gleanings*, Selection CXXVIII, p. 278

i.e., as mentioned, "Bahá."

Again the first two letters of the name "Hasan" (as indeed of "Husayn" also).

i.e. Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí, who is known to have been occupied with various secretarial functions during his Father's lifetime.

"O SON OF MAN! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy bed, or to shed thy life-blood on the dust, a martyr in My path, and so become the manifestation of My command and the revealer of My light in the highest paradise? Judge thou aright, O servant!"---Arabic Hidden Words, No. 46

i.e. of an untoward nature.

The Tablet contains no direct indication that it is addressed to the King of Martyrs, and the matter should therefore be carefully verified in reliable copies of the original.*

i.e. Tihrán.

The identity of the recipient of the Tablet is not at present known. Apparently not Mullá Zaynu'l-'Ábidín of Najaf-Ábád, who was designated by Bahá'u'lláh "Zaynu'l-Muqarrabín." Possibly the Áqá Mírzá Zaynu'l-'Ábidín-i-Káshíy-i-Jarráh whom Áqá Husayn-'Alí several times mentions in the aforesaid *Khátirát-i-Muhájirí az Isfahán*; or perhaps the latter's younger brother Áqá Zaynu\'l-'Ábidín.*

See Qur'án, 52.4.

See Qur'án, 17.79.

i.e. Mírzá Áqá Ján, the amanuensis of Bahá'u'lláh.

i.e. Muhammad.

See Qur'án, 26.58 & 44.26.

Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, known as Áqá Mírzá Áqá, Núri'd-Dín, the third Afnán to accept the Báb.

i.e. into cool and safety (*bard wa salám*): see Qur'án, 21.69.

The Tablet is in the voice of Mírzá Áqá Ján, the amanuensis of Bahá'u'lláh.

sc. following the example of Muhammad, who is related in the Muslim Traditions to have prayed: "O Lord! Increase my bewilderment in Thee!" The same expression is rendered in *Gleanings*, Selection LXXXII, p. 162, in a different context, as "Increase my wonder and amazement at Thee, O God!"

sc. of Bahjí.

i.e. after September 1879. On this theme Bahá'u'lláh says in one of His Tablets: "O My Afnán! Thy call was privileged to be heard by thy Lord, and thy letter was honoured in the Most Sublime Vision, this Mansion which God hath appointed as the seat of His mighty throne. This is a station from whence are seen, on the right hand, the ocean; on the left hand the mountain and the plain; and before it orchards wherein are flaming citrus fruits like balls of fire, and flowers like the stars of heaven. Thus doth the Pen of the Most High depict the scene, that thou mayest be of the joyful... "---*Má'idiy-i-Ásimání*, Vol. 4, p. 354

i.e. Mihdí: probably Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Dahají, who had been designated by Bahá'u'lláh "Ismu'lláhi'l-Mihdí" ("The Name of God Mihdí \The Guided").*

i.e. the younger brother of the Twin Shining Lights.

This passage is evidently addressed to the whole company of the Afnáns (the Báb's relatives).*

Presumably the Beloved of Martyrs, as is made clearer in the second Tablet to Varqá below.*

The Angel of Life (cf. The Seven Valleys, "The Valley of Knowledge," p. 14).

Rendered in a different context in *Gleanings*, Selection CXIV, p. 233, as "He that giveth up himself wholly to God, God shall, assuredly, be with him."

i.e. conformably with the tenor of the above-quoted saying: "Whoso is for God, God is for him." The principle is very similar to that expressed by the exhortation, "Love Me, that I may love thee."

i.e. when the Manifestation of God is still alive, and His Countenance unveiled before men.

sc. in view of the respect owed to faithful members of the Báb's family; cf. Bahá'u'lláh's injunction in the Book of His Covenant to "manifest love" towards His own family members, the Aghsán (p. 222).

sc. that of Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl, enclosed in that of Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad.

sc. to Bahá'u'lláh by His amanuensis, and ostensible "author" of this letter, Mírzá Áqá Ján.

i.e. Bahá'u'lláh.

sc. to Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl.

i.e. Bahá'u'lláh (as is apparent from the plural number of the verb in the original).

i.e. The Báb.

i.e. the King and the Beloved of Martyrs.

Again, the whole company of the Afnáns seems to be intended.*

In fact the following matter seems merely to be the continuation of that preceding: see *Má'idiy-i-Ásimání*, Vol. VIII, pp. 176-184 (particularly p. 181).*

i.e. the clarity with which future events are foretold in the Writings is among the circumstances that leaves no room for anyone to doubt, or harbour reservations about, the Cause.

i.e. the Lawh-i-Fu'ád (Tablet of Fu'ád) and the Lawh-i-Ra'ís (Tablet of the Chief), addressed respectively to Fu'ád Páshá, the Ottoman Minister of Foreign Affairs, and 'Álí Páshá, the Ottoman Grand Vizir. The Lawh-i-Ra'ís was in fact Bahá'u'lláh's second Tablet to the Ottoman Grand Vizir.

"The Tablet of Paris;" i.e. the second Tablet to the French Emperor Napoleon III.

sc. the Most Great Prison.

Son of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan, the Afnán-i-Kabír (The Great Afnán).

i.e. (as appears from the following), one of the Twin Shining Lights, it is not stated which. Considering, however, the distressful circumstances in which the family of the King of Martyrs were left after his passing, necessitating their transference to the Holy Land, one might assume that it is he: "Because the family was in such straits, Bahá'u'lláh directed them to come to the Most Great Prison so that, sheltered in these precincts of abounding grace, they might be compensated for all that had passed."---'Abdu'l-Bahá, *Memorials of the Faithful*, "The Consort of the King of Martyrs," p. 173; quoted above in Section One.*

An appropriate blessing for one of the Twin Shining Lights.

i.e. Bahá'u'lláh.

It is not easy to determine whether this passage is addressed to Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad specifically; to both him and the aforesaid Áqá Siyyid Ahmad; or, as previously, to the Afnán as a body.*

i.e. material means considered as the agency whereby God effects His purpose in the world.

"Hold ye fast unto the cord of means and place your trust in God, the Provider of all means."---The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Paragraph 33; see also Paragraphs 113 & 160.

The change in person at this point from the (direct) second to the (deferential) third plural in addressing the recipient of the letter indicates that the words of Bahá'u'lláh here come to an end.*

The Tablet ends in the published version with the letters "Khá' Alif Dál Mím" spelling "Khádim."*

The identity of the recipient of the Tablet is not at present known. Possibly Áqá 'Alíy-i-Isfahání, surnamed "Núr" ("Light"), father of the aforesaid Áqá Husayn-'Alí whose reminiscences are set forth in *Khátirát-i-Muhájirí az Isfahán*, considering that he is subsequently exhorted -- as if in allusion to his surname -- to "meditate upon the *Light* (*Núr*) that shone forth from the Land of Sád."*

i.e. 'Alí, the recipient of this Tablet, had deferentially addressed his remarks to Bahá'u'lláh through one of the friends serving in the Holy Land, rather than directly to Bahá'u'lláh Himself.

Cf. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Paragraph 36: "By the righteousness of the one true God! Were anyone to wash the feet of all mankind, and were he to worship God in the forests, valleys, and mountains, upon high hills and lofty peaks, to leave no rock or tree, no clod of earth, but was a witness to his worship -- yet, should the fragrance of My good pleasure not be inhaled from him, his works would never be acceptable unto God."

i.e. an indication, whether written or spoken, of the good pleasure of the Manifestation of God. In one of His Tablets, Bahá'u'lláh says: "O Murtadá! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all mankind. The Herald of this Most Great Revelation saith: 'All is to the end of being mentioned in His Court, though it be but once.' In this day, the treasures of the earth cannot compare with a single word expressive of good pleasure that hath emanated from the Pen of the Most High. Blessed be those souls who have been favoured with such a word, and become possessed of a Divine Tablet."---*La'áli'u'l-Hikmah*, Vol. III, p. 352

In the absence of further identification, one might assume that the King of Martyrs is intended.*

i.e. his state of ideal, constructive martyrdom was crowned by an actual martyrdom in the flesh. Cf. the following passage of similar import from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh: "In this day, service to the Cause is among the greatest of all deeds. Well-assured souls must, with perfect wisdom, occupy themselves in teaching the Cause of God, so that the fragrances of the Divine garment may be diffused in all regions. Such testimony is not limited to martyrdom and the shedding of one's blood, *for it may chance that a person, although living in comfortable circumstances, is still registered in the Book of Him Who is the Lord of all names as a martyr.*"---quoted in *Payám-i-Ásimání*, Vol. I, p. 24

i.e. that of the "true," or living, martyrdom.

In other words the friends, even though not mentioned by name, should rest contented in the knowledge that they are known and remembered, and their names recorded, in the realms above.

i.e. the Jews.

i.e. Mírzá 'Alí-Muhammad, Hand of the Cause, Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh, and distinguished Bahá'í poet.

Note the antithesis in these propositions between respectively heaven & earth, and inward & outward.

It is not at present known who was the author of this quasi-poetic remark.*

i.e. the King and the Beloved of Martyrs would no more give up their love and devotion to the Cause of God than would this nomadic desert-dweller part with a single hair of his beloved coarse felt raiment.

i.e. Bahá'u'lláh.

The Tablet is again in the voice of Mírzá Áqá Ján, the amanuensis of Bahá'u'lláh.

It may be noted how similar is this description of the circumstances of the Twin Shining Lights to that provided in the above-quoted Tablet to Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, known as Áqá Mírzá Áqá, Núri'd-Dín, which is also in the voice of Mírzá Áqá Ján, the amanuensis of Bahá'u'lláh.

It is not at present known who was the recipient of this Tablet.*

"For several years Bahá'u'lláh in His Tablets continued to make mention of them, to voice His grief over their passing and to extol their virtues."---*God Passes By*, p. 201

i.e., presumably, the King of Martyrs, to whom this title appears to attach (see Section Three above).*

Reminiscent of a series of similar expressions, beginning "Grievous is it...," in the latter portion of the "Prayer of Nudbih *or* Lamentation," mentioned in the Kitáb-i-Íqán (see pp. 35 + note & 240).

i.e. "O Thou Manifestation of the Godhead in His character of the Most Merciful!" It will be seen that Bahá'u'lláh is almost indistinguishably merged with the Godhead throughout this prayer.

The martyrdom of the King and the Beloved of Martyrs occurred on 17 March 1879, and thus would still have been a recent event, and the news of it yet more so, on the first day of Ridván that year.

Reminiscent again of the Prayer of Nudbih.

i.e. the persona of Isfahán.

Literally, "Siyyid:" a reference to his sacred lineage.

i.e. the period of Ridván, shortly before which the martyrdom occurred.

sc. implying an identification of Bahá'u'lláh with the Prophet Sálih.

Sound made by a female camel expressive of affection for her young.

i.e. in the capacity of an intercessor.

An allusion to the "great sacrifice" stated in the Qur'án (37.107) to have been offered by Abraham as a ransom for His son Ishmael, and which has been described by commentators as a mighty ram brought down from heaven by the angel Gabriel -- the very sacrifice originally offered by Abel (see Genesis 4).

Cf. the words of similar purport in the next-but-one preceding Tablet: "O My Name Há'! We, verily, concealed thy station whilst thou wast on earth, by reason of the frailty of Our servants: then, when thou wast ascended, We revealed thee, and made manifest all that thou art, and that which God, the Almighty, the All-Praised, had bestowed upon thee."

See the preceding note on "Most Great Ransom."

i.e. "My Name Há'" -- contrasting by antithesis with the "Well-Beloved" in the preceding.

i.e. the Imám Husayn.

The wording of the original text here, "*karbí wa balá'í*," puns on the name "Karbilá."

i.e. Isfahán.

An allusion, perhaps, to the gathering held at the home of the Imám-Jum'ih on 17 Rabí'u'l-Avval 1296 to mark the Birthday of the Prophet, where measures were set in train leading to their martyrdom.

i.e. the specific pronouncement about to be quoted in the following sentence.

sc. as represented in this case by the Báb.

i.e. came to pass in the physical realm.

See the Qayyúmu'l-Asmá', Chapter 29, the "Súrih of the Húrí" ("*Súratu'l-Húríyyah*").

i.e. they match the description provided in the quoted extract from the Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'.

The referent of the pronoun is now the whole company of martyrs.

The image is from falconry.

i.e. in respect alike of their relation to the Truth and of their interaction with each other, a state affirmed in the Qur'án to be typical of the oppressors and the unbelievers.

Bahá'u'lláh appears to apply the familiar term -- so intimately associated in the Bahá'í Revelation with the idea of a garden -- to Isfahán, perhaps in reference to the many gardens (*ríyád*) for which the city is renowned. As previously noted, the modern cemetery of Isfahán has been named precisely the Bágh-i-Ridván (the Garden of Ridván). Alternatively, He may simply be *personifying* the Festival of Ridván, for, as mentioned, it was around this season that the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights occurred.*

The invocation derives from the shortly-to-be-quoted passage of the Qayyúmu'l-Asmá', suggesting that the present apostrophe to Bahá'u'lláh, notwithstanding that it is ostensibly attributed to the "Ridván" of Isfahán, proceeds in reality from the Báb. "Out of utter nothingness, *O great and omnipotent Master,* Thou hast, through the celestial potency of Thy might, brought me forth and raised me up to proclaim this Revelation. I have made none other but Thee my trust; I have clung to no will but Thy will... *O Thou Remnant of God! I have sacrificed myself wholly for Thee: I have accepted curses for Thy sake, and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in the path of Thy love.* Sufficient witness unto me is God, the Exalted, the Protector, the Ancient of Days."---*The Dispensation of Bahá'u'lláh,* p. 101

The possessive adjective is capitalized on the assumption that the speaker may be the Báb.*

The name and identity of the recipient of the Tablet are not at present known.*

A different version of this Visitation Tablet, omitting the previous and following paragraphs, but including further matter after that next-but-one following, is given at the end of Section Three above. Both versions should be carefully checked against a reliable copy.*

i.e. the actual graves themselves (for the original expression might be taken in a metaphorical sense).

In order to visit the martyrs' resting-place in a large cemetery such as Takhtih-Fúlád, it would be necessary first to *know* generally in what quarter it was situated; having ascertained this, to *find* it amidst a host of other graves; and finally to thread one's way between them in order to *come before* it.

The opening passage of the Visitation Tablet appears in fact to be addressed to the whole company of the martyrs of Isfahán (who are then addressed separately in the previous version of the Tablet).*

The visitant is here given the opportunity to beseech the fulfilment of some personal need.

Bahá'u'lláh here plays on the literal meaning of the addressee's name, or title, of Khalíl ("Friend, Companion") which, as noted, is a designation of the Prophet Abraham. The referent of the name is not at present known. Possibly the famous Bahá'í teacher, Muhammad-Ibráhím-i-Qazvíní, surnamed "Khalíl."*

Reminiscent of the passage of similar import in a preceding Tablet: "Did the people think that they had gained by their transaction? Nay, by Him Who is the King of Names! God is My witness that they suffered a loss such as hath had no equal in the knowledge of God, the Lord of the throne above and of earth below. The Tongue of Grandeur testifieth that it is thou who hast gained by this transaction. Nay by My life! All gain is thine, inasmuch as thou hast quit the earth, whose every atom beareth witness unto its evanescence; hast set thy face towards the dawning-place of eternity; and hast yielded thy life in thy yearning for the love of God, the Creator of the heavens and the Lord of all names."

Cf. the famous words of Hugh Latimer to Nicholas Ridley, as both were about to be burned at the stake outside Balliol College, Oxford, for heresy: "Be of good comfort, Master Ridley, and play the man: *we shall this day this light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.*"

As is frequently the case in these Tablets, it is not made clear which of the two martyrs is intended.*

i.e. the foreign communities resident in Isfahán.

Perhaps they conjectured him to be the Promised One of the Bayán.*

i.e., as intimated in the preceding sentence, of the Word of God; cf. Qur'án, 14.24.

i.e. grow from a sapling into a mighty tree, shadowing all peoples (cf. *The Dawn-Breakers*, p. 77).

i.e. all that has been set down in the Sacred Writ shall come to pass outwardly on earth.

Used in the Bahá'í Writings as a generic term for the prison-city of 'Akká: "'Know thou,' Bahá'u'lláh, wishing to emphasize the criticalness of the first nine years of His banishment to that prison-city, has written, 'that upon Our arrival at this Spot, We chose to designate it as the "Most Great Prison." Though previously subjected in another land (Tihrán) to chains and fetters, We yet refused to call it by that name. Say: Ponder thereon, O ye endued with understanding!'"---*God Passes By,* p. 185

The event of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights had occasioned great consternation to the friends in Isfahán -- whence the recipient of the Tablet should have some connection with that city.*

The description applied in the Qur'án to those who deny the reality of the Day of Judgment (83.12).

A term associated, as previously noted, with the Mansion of Bahjí.

A sign of the Day of Resurrection; see Qur'án, 54.1.

Or more literally, a "wondrous *gathering* (*hashr*):" it is recorded in the Islamic Traditions that the scene of the great gathering associated with the Day of Resurrection is the land of Syria.

Cf. Qur'án, 16.77: "... the matter of the Last Hour is as the twinkling of an eye, or yet swifter ..."

Explicitly identified in Bahá'í Scripture as the "rays" emanating from the Sun of Truth.

Echoing similar protestations recorded in the Qur'án to have been uttered by the unbelievers.

i.e. such reactions have been predetermined in Holy Scripture.

The very *antithesis* of the quality of *fidelity* manifested to a supreme degree by the "manifestations of fidelity," and in particular by the "King of Fidelity," alike in their temporal and in their spiritual affairs.

i.e. 'Akká: interestingly, the Arabic original of this description (*al-ardu'l-baydá'*) signifies literally, "a land without vegetation," recalling that during the nine years of Bahá'u'lláh's confinement behind the prison walls of 'Akká, "even the sight of verdure was denied Him" (see *God Passes By*, p. 293).

The intention of the remark is elucidated in the following sentence.

Again, it is not clear to which of the two martyrs reference is here made.*

The image is again from falconry.

i.e., as previously mentioned, Fátimih, from whom all Siyyids trace their descent.

i.e. the Prophet Muhammad, the scene of Whose ministry was the Hijáz region of western Arabia.

i.e. Hasan and Husayn, the second and third Imáms, and Zaynab. The latter is noted for her sorrow at the untimely loss of many close family members, including Husayn, martyred at the Battle of Karbilá; and for having on that occasion saved the life of his son Zaynu'l-'Ábidín, subsequently to be the fourth Imám. She is here doubtless intended as a type of the "sorrowing Fátimih Begum, widow of the King of Martyrs."

Alluding to the portent of Christ's second coming (see Matthew 24.29; Mark 13.25; & Luke 21.26).

Again the Prophet Muhammad.

Confirming the peculiar association, already remarked upon, of Hasan with the quality of fidelity.*

Fádil-i-Mázindarání, in his account of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights in Section Nine below, represents Husayn as resisting his brother Hasan's suggestion that he should seek, by identifying the latter as solely obnoxious to the charge of Bahá'í affiliation, to save himself so as to look after their two families.

sc. of the members of the Holy Family; and so likewise in the case of the following "impious."

i.e. all members of the Holy Household, whether good or bad, should be respected; cf. Bahá'u'lláh's injunction in the Book of the Covenant: "It is enjoined upon everyone to manifest love towards the Aghsán, but God hath not granted them any right to the property of others."

i.e. Bahá'u'lláh, Who, as the Mouthpiece of the Primal Will, is the source of all the Holy Books.

i.e. again Bahá'u'lláh, Who for the same reason is considered the source of all prophetic missions.

Presumably again the Prophet Muhammad, in view of the consistency of the nautical imagery employed in this invocation, and the passage it introduces, with the notion of a sea disaster, such as was earlier stated to have overtaken the Ark of the Prophet, leading to the drowning of those on board.

Cf. "Bahá'u'lláh loved the beauty and verdure of the country. One day He passed the remark: 'I have not gazed on verdure for nine years. *The country is the world of the soul, the city is the world of bodies*.'"---words of 'Abdu'l-Bahá quoted in *Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era*, p. 35; "Abdu'l-Bahá likened the country to the soul and the city to the body of man, saying, 'The body without the soul cannot live. It is good,' he remarked, 'to live under the sky, in the sunshine and fresh air.'"---*'Abdu'l-Bahá in London*, p. 81

The pronoun is capitalized on the assumption that the speaker is the Prophet Muhammad.*

The croaking of the raven, as opposed to the "melody of the nightingale," is taken in the Bahá'í Writings to typify opposition to the Cause, whether from within or from without.

Shaykh Kázim of Qazvín, one of the nineteen Apostles of Bahá'u'lláh.

sc. on account of the renewed slaughter of their offspring Hasan and Husayn.

For the death of the former Hasan and Husayn had also been at the hand of the Muslims.

i.e. the latter Hasan and Husayn, who, as her descendants, are still in a sense her children.

Reminiscent of the statement in a preceding Tablet: "O My Name Há'! We, verily, concealed thy station whilst thou wast on earth, by reason of the frailty of Our servants: then, when thou wast ascended, We revealed thee, and made manifest all that thou art, and that which God, the Almighty, the All-Praised, had bestowed upon thee."

i.e. Mír Muhammad-Husayn the "She-Serpent," and Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir the "Wolf."

i.e. the Battle of Karbilá, at which the Imám Husayn was slain.

Literally, "Husayn departed from his limit: he was slain by his grandsire's sword" ("*Qad kharaja Husaynun 'an haddih: qutila bi-sayfi jaddih*").

i.e. His as yet juvenile descendants.

i.e. the Twin Shining Lights, Mullá Kázim, and, presumably, Mírzá Ashraf, who has not so far been mentioned in these pages, but of whom notice will be taken in Section Seven: "Mírzá Ashraf was slain in Isfahán, his corpse trampled under foot by Shaykh Muhammad-Taqíy-i-Najafí, the 'son of the wolf,' and his pupils, savagely mutilated, and delivered to the mob to be burnt, after which his charred bones were buried beneath the ruins of a wall that was pulled down to cover them."---*God Passes By*, p. 201 (Cf. also the following from the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 72: "Before them \sc. the Twin Shining Lights\ the one named Kázim and they who were with him, and after them, his honour Ashraf, all quaffed the draught of martyrdom with the utmost fervour and longing, and hastened unto the Supreme Companion.")*

i.e. heart-rending eulogies and lamentations, such as many of the Tablets included in this section.

i.e. as though it were the raiment of Joseph which, when cast over the countenance of his father Jacob, who had become blind through grief at separation from his beloved son, restored the light to his eyes.

The Tablet bears no obvious reference to the martyrs of Isfahán, albeit a connection may perhaps be detected in its theme of *generosity*: "A month later occurred in that same city the tragedy of the two famous brothers Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan and Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, the 'Twin Shining Lights,' respectively surnamed 'Sultánu'sh-Shuhadá' (King of Martyrs) and 'Mahbúbu'sh-Shuhadá' (Beloved of Martyrs), *who were celebrated for their generosity, trustworthiness, kindliness and piety.*"---*God Passes By*, p. 200 *

sc. with the virtue of generosity.

i.e. on the grounds that if the poverty be not "conspicuous," then there is no need to give.

i.e. the time when the performance of goodly deeds is most likely to yield an abundant harvest of results. "Man is like unto a tree: if he be adorned with fruit, then is he worthy of praise and commendation; otherwise a tree without fruit is fit for the fire. The fruits of the tree of man are most delicate, agreeable and well-pleasing. A praiseworthy character, goodly deeds and a kindly word are accounted among the fruits of this tree. The springtime of trees in the physical world occurreth, as is witnessed, but once a year; *whereas the springtime of the tree of man is the days of the revelation of the One True God.* If, during this Divine springtime, the trees of existence become adorned with the aforesaid fruits, then will the lights of the sun of justice assuredly encompass the whole earth, and all will behold themselves detached and at rest beneath the shadow of His Holiness the Adored One "---*Payám-i-Ásimání*, Vol. I, p. 27

i.e. the same people addressed as "ye" in the preceding passage: rhetorically, the sentence exhibits a form of "*iltifát*" -- that is, "apostrophe" in its literal sense of "turning away."

See Qur'án, 3.26.

The identity of the addressee is not at present known.*

The recipients of the Tablet, although not explicitly identified, are presumed from its contents to be the family and kindred of either, or both, of the Twin Shining Lights. In view of the inclusion of the King of Martyrs with the Holy Family (see Section One above), the word "household" has been capitalized.*

The same addressed in an earlier Tablet.

See Qur'án, 22.3.

By the testimony of the Qur'án, Húd and Sálih were the Prophets sent respectively to the Arabian tribes of 'Ád and Thamúd, which, when they disdainfully repudiated these Divine Messengers (as, in the latter case, by hamstringing the She-Camel), were destroyed for their disbelief. Cf. the similar statement in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 100 (quoted in the Tablet of the Proof in Section Eight below).

i.e. the Angel Gabriel: see Qur'án, 26.193.

i.e. as though it were the actual wolf alleged by his brothers, in the Qur'ánic account, to have devoured Joseph (see Qur'án, 12.13-18).

An inveterate opponent of Muhammad, who met his death at the Battle of Badr.

sc. as the Seal of the Prophets.

i.e., presumably, the She-Serpent: "Their martyrdom was instigated by the wicked and dishonest Mír Muhammad-Husayn, the Imám-Jum'ih, stigmatised by Bahá'u'lláh as the 'she-serpent,' who, in view of a large debt he had incurred in his transactions with them, schemed to nullify his obligations by denouncing them as Bábís, and thereby encompassing their death."---*God Passes By*, pp. 200-201*

i.e. they could at once be despatched by various means in retribution for their actions, rather than afflicted with deaths, which, retributive as they still are, might appear to result from natural causes.

Cf. Bahá'u'lláh's similar statement in the previous Tablet to Khalíl: "Verily, should He wish it, He could lay hold on all the peoples of the earth through a word from Him; howbeit He revealeth His Cause pursuant to a wisdom that lieth hidden in his all-embracing knowledge."

i.e. their counterparts in previous ages (cf. the Kitáb-i-Íqán, p. 150).

These will now take up the remaining course of the Tablet.

It is clear from the Bahá'í Writings that a special virtue attaches to receiving some favour from the Manifestation of God -- as a Tablet in one's honour -- during the days of His earthly existence.

Mashhadí Muhammad-Rahím (see *Eminent Bahá'ís*, H. M. Balyuzi, pp. 62-63).

Samandar is requested, by reading out to his paternal uncle the words with which Bahá'u'lláh has *made mention* of him, himself as it were to "make mention" of his relative on His, Bahá'u'lláh's, behalf.

i.e. the aforesaid Muhammad-Rahím, paternal uncle of Samandar.

i.e. a heart turned unto God in virtue of its being turned unto His Manifestation Bahá'u'lláh.

i.e. during His lifetime.

i.e. in the Holy Land.

Possibly the same extolled on p. 64 of *Memorials of the Faithful*.*

The following is a Visitation Tablet for 'Abdu'r-Rahím.

sc. by replying "Yea" to God's primordial Call "Am I not your Lord?," as voiced anew in the present Day by the tongue of Bahá'u'lláh.

i.e. Muhammad-'Alí.

i.e., as indicated in the preceding sentence, that all should seek to behold it.

i.e. Hasan Khán.

Cf.: "Great is the Day, and mighty the Call! In one of Our Tablets We have revealed these exalted words: 'Were the world of the spirit to be wholly converted into the sense of hearing, it could then claim to be worthy to hearken unto the Voice that calleth from the Supreme Horizon; for otherwise, these ears that are defiled with lying tales have never been, nor are they now, fit to hear it.' Well is it with them that hearken; and woe betide the wayward.'"---Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 30

A new addressee.

i.e., again, Muhammad-'Alí ("Nabíl," signifying "Noble," being often used in the Bahá'í Writings in place of "Muhammad," in view of its sharing with the latter the numerical value of 92).

To summarize, then, the Tablet, although addressed to Shaykh Kázim-i-Samandar, contains subsidiary addresses to: Samandar's paternal uncle Muhammad-Rahím, Ibráhím, 'Alí, Muhammad-'Alí, Hasan Khán, and Husayn; as well as notices of (between the addresses to 'Alí and Muhammad-'Alí) the consort of 'Abdu'r-Rahím and 'Abdu'r-Rahím himself (including in the latter case a Visitation Tablet), and, at the very end of the Tablet, another Muhammad-'Alí -- that is, ten individuals all told.

Cf. Qur'án, 53.7 & 81.23.

Cf. Qur'án, 50.41.

Cf. Qur'án, 28.30; also 19.52 & 20.80.

Signifying that the language of the original here changes from Arabic to Persian.

The identities both of these friends, who had recently been visited by a calamity, and of the visitor who, as is subsequently stated, made mention of them "before the throne," are not at present known.*

sc. the victims of the aforesaid calamity (presumably the martyrs of Isfahán).

sc. imbuing him with a conviction of its impermanence: as Bahá'u'lláh says in a Tablet included in the following section: "The evanescence of the world, and the ephemerality of all things in it, are matters about which there is no doubt, and no right-minded person will set his heart upon that which must inevitably pass away, nor will he rest satisfied and content with the ease of a few fleeting days."

i.e. the aforesaid "friends" had *heard*, *seen*, and *experienced* all kinds of abusive treatment, but consistently responded in the mild and inoffensive manner enjoined in the Bahá'í Writings.

Cf. the similar statement in a previous Tablet addressed to the Land of Sád: "The nightingale hath taken flight, inasmuch as the croaking of the raven hath been raised."

i.e. Muhammad-Ridá; but beyond this the identity of the recipient of the Tablet is not at present known.*

i.e. as a salutary example of the severity with which God lays hold upon the oppressors.

sc. and reflects that just as the dire consequences Bahá'u'lláh there informed 'Álí Páshá would befall both him and his country -- even while He was to all appearances entirely at the latter's mercy -- came to pass, so too the prophecies denounced in the present Tablet against the oppressors would be fulfilled.

The identity of the recipient of the Tablet is not at present known, albeit it is apparent from the context that he was an associate (as an Afnán), or perhaps a relative, of the King and the Beloved of Martyrs.*

i.e. John the Baptist, the son of Zacharias (Zakaríyyá).

i.e. Herodias, on whose account the tetrarch Herod put John the Baptist, who had reproached him for taking her to wife, in prison. As noted, the Twin Shining Lights suffered this same fate of decapitation.

i.e. the Imám Husayn, who also suffered decapitation: "The tenth day is called 'Áshúrá and commemorates the martyrdom of Husayn, the grand-son of Muhammad, who was cut down by thirty-three strokes of swords and lances and decapitated: his clothes were torn from him and his naked body trampled by horses hooves."---*Arohanui, Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand*, p. 98

i.e. the Umayyad Caliph Yazíd I.

The same distinction is observed in the case of these two contrasting epithets -- "greatest" and "mightiest" -- as in the case of the epithets applied to the "Greater" and the "Most Great" Branch.

i.e., presumably, of the Bahá'ís in general; or perhaps, if the addressee is an Afnán, of that family.*

Doubtless the precipitate nature of His martyrdom precluded him from settling his affairs beforehand.

In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, settlement of the debts of the deceased ranks only second, as a claim on the estate, after the funeral and burial expenses (see Questions and Answers, Item 9).

i.e. in so many words convey Bahá'u'lláh's remembrances to them.

Although the identity of the recipient of the Tablet, a lady, is not at present known, it may perhaps be inferred that she is the wife of the Afnán subsequently stated to be on a visit to the Holy Land; and that it was this very visit which provided the occasion for her to address to Bahá'u'lláh a letter by his hand.*

A description sometimes applied to the Prophet Muhammad and members of the Holy Family.

Cf. the statement in the Tablet to Khalíl above: "From time immemorial even until now, the Divine Lote Tree, which the hand of God's sovereign purpose hath planted in the good and blessed land, hath been watered by the blood of them that are wholly devoted to His Cause, and truly recognize His unity."

i.e. all necessary measures will be taken to ensure the safety of the friends.

i.e. upon the addressee's kindred male and female alike.

It is not clear what immediate connection this Tablet has with the Twin Shining Lights.*

The same identified as recipient of a Tablet from which an extract was cited earlier in this section.

The language of the Tablet here changes from Arabic to Persian, providing an occasion for the substance of the preceding to be briefly summarized before the principal matter of the Tablet is introduced.

i.e. the Twin Shining Lights.

Cf. the similar statements in two previous Tablets: i) "... the Hand of Divine power raised them up and arrayed them with the robe of honour; and from the cloud of bounty blessings rained down upon them, ...;" and ii) "... yet the Hand of Divine power raised them up; arrayed them with the robe of honour; and from the heaven of bounty rained down blessings upon them, ..."

Cf. the statements in the same aforesaid two previous Tablets: i) "What greater bounty is there than this, that, praise be to God, in the nether world they were identified with the name of the True One, it being observed that even the ungodly behaved with deference in their presence; while at the end of their days they attained a station whose description is beyond aught that the pen of this servant could compass, or the tongue of this evanescent one express?" and ii) "Consider now: praise be to God, so long as they lived, they were seen to occupy, through the loving-kindness of the One True God, a position of the utmost honour among His servants, love for them indeed having been instilled into people's hearts to a degree that none save God, the True One, hath ever been, or is now, able to reckon; while at the end of their days they attained unto that Supreme Sacrifice which they themselves had sought."

sc. and not out of sorrow over the incident *per se*, which would betray a lack of true reliance.

Cf. the statements in two previous Tablets: i) "Subsequent to their return to the Land of Sád, two letters came from them to the Most Holy Court, and likewise other letters. Therein, with utmost lowliness and ardour, they craved, and expressed the hope of attaining, the very station which afterwards they won." and ii) "After their return from the Most Holy Court unto the Land of Sád, they despatched hither two letters wherein, with utmost lowliness and ardour, they besought of Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High, the very thing which actually befell."

Cf. the statement in an earlier Tablet: "Although this calamity is most grievous, and the greatest abasement hath been witnessed on its account, yet, by the righteousness of God, is it in reality the mightiest honour, which hath but outwardly assumed the form of an abasement." also Bahá'u'lláh's advice on p. 29 of the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf: "Say, O friends! Strive that haply the tribulations suffered by this Wronged One and by you, in the path of God, may not prove to have been in vain."

Glancing back again at the backs, eyes and ears mentioned in the fourth preceding sentence.

Reinforcing the idea that afflictions and the remembrance of God are alike instances of His bounty.

Cf. the similar exhortation in a previous Tablet in this section: "Say: Lay hold upon a praiseworthy character and goodly deeds, and be not of them that tarry. It behoveth every soul to cleave unto that whereby the Cause of God, your Lord, the Most Powerful, the Almighty, may be exalted."

The Tablet now reverts to addressing Varqá, after the previous apostrophe to all the "Friends."

Possibly the father of Varqá, whose story is told in *Memorials of the Faithful*, pp. 84-86.*

Ustád Kázim of Yazd, mentioned in passing in *The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh*, Vol. III, p. 303.

Addressed to Ustád Kázim, and so to the end of the Tablet.

Ustád 'Alí-Akbar, designer of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in 'Ishqábád, who is addressed in Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet of Tajallíyát. (See *Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas*, p. 48.)

i.e. Mullá Kázim-i-Tálkhúnchi'í, who, as noted, was martyred in Isfahán a month before the Twin Shining Lights.

i.e. the *namesake* of the martyr, who is the addressee of this concluding portion of the Tablet to Varqá.

i.e., presumably, Husayn the Beloved of Martyrs; quoted in the Tablet to Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad the Afnán above. As there explained, this Word was uttered in preceding Dispensations (most notably, in the Arabic form in which it is here cited, by the Prophet Muhammad), and has thus been *re-revealed* in the Bahá'í Dispensation: "Although this Word is ancient -- meaning that the Manifestations of the Cause spake it of old -- yet today is it made manifest in a wondrous new attire, inasmuch as the true Isráfíl hath breathed a fresh spirit of meaning into the temples of words. It is this: 'Whoso is for God, God is for him.'"*

As previously noted, an emblem of superiority and success (from the ancient Arabian game of *maysir*).

Echoing Hagar's fervent entreaties for Divine favour on being abandoned in the desert with Ishmael.

sc. as represented especially by this outpouring of Tablets commemorating the martyrs.

As becomes apparent from the continuation of the Tablet, its recipient is one "Javád," by whom may be intended (since it appears he was resident in the Holy Land), Muhammad-Javád-i-Qazvíní, who was for years occupied in transcribing, and making fair copies of, the Tablets revealed by Bahá'u'lláh.*

See Qur'án, 89.14.

i.e., presumably, the She-Serpent, as noted in connection with the statement in the second Tablet to Samandar: "After Hasan and Husayn had attained their goal, and the allotted days had passed, We laid hold upon him that was the source of tyranny and injustice, through the power of Our sovereign might."*

The following short apostrophe may be taken as addressed to Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir the "Wolf," the surviving ringleader of the conspiracy to compass the death of the King and the Beloved of Martyrs.

sc. according to the charge preferred against him.

Cf. the similar passage addressed by Bahá'u'lláh to Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir in the Lawh-i-Burhán: "The children of the Apostle have been slain and their possessions pillaged. Say: Was it, in thine estimation, their possessions or themselves that denied God? Judge fairly, O ignorant one that hath been shut out as by a veil from God."---*Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas*, p. 215

The pronoun is plural, so must be understood to refer to all the martyrs of Isfahán.*

i.e., presumably, those resident in the Holy Land, whether or not related to Bahá'u'lláh.*

The language of the Tablet here changes from Arabic to Persian, providing an occasion for certain matters already touched upon in the "Eloquent Tongue" to be reiterated in the "Luminous Tongue."

Apparently, Mullá 'Alí-Akbar-i-Shahmírzádí, "Hájí Ákhund," the Hand of the Cause.*

Indicating that the recipient of 'Alí-Akbar's letter, "Javád," was resident in the Holy Land, and that he had forwarded the said letter through Mírzá Áqá Ján to Bahá'u'lláh, possibly out of concern over its tenor.*

sc. containing the "Verses which had erewhile been sent down from the Dayspring of God's loving-kindness especially for him," and to which, it seems, he may have responded in the letter he sent to Javád.*

Cf. the complementary statement in a previous Tablet: "O Khalíl! A mighty happening hath come to pass in the world. Though yet greater hath previously occurred, even as thou thyself dost witness and attest, yet, since a considerable period had elapsed during which the Hand of Divine Power had been exercising its protective sway -- when of a sudden this inexorable Divine judgment befell -- for this reason did it become a cause of wailing, of weeping and of great commotion."

i.e. Hasan and Husayn, the "Hasanayn."

Bahá'u'lláh, it seems, now apostrophizes 'Alí-Akbar, whose observations in the letter he sent to Javád in the Holy Land had provided the occasion for the revelation of this Tablet.*

i.e. not just a perfunctory or grudging thanks -- far less a complaint such as was actually received!

Cf. the similar statements in preceding Tablets: i) "From time immemorial even until now, the Divine Lote Tree, which the hand of God's sovereign purpose hath planted in the good and blessed land, hath been watered by the blood of them that are wholly devoted to His Cause, and truly recognize His unity." and ii) "Although outwardly this matter \sc. the 'supreme calamity' mentioned in the preceding sentence\ seareth the heart, yet is it, and shall it ever be, the means and cause of the growth of the Divine Lote Tree."

Extracts quoted from this Tablet have in fact been identified in Section Three above as originating from a Tablet to Zaynu'l-Muqarrabín.*

i.e. innumerable lives and possessions have perished on account of the Divine retribution entailed by these grievous transgressions.

sc. giving order for the victim's execution: it was 'Umar Ibn-i-Sa'd, a deputy of 'Ubaydu'lláh, the governor of Kúfih at the time of the Battle of Karbilá, who gave the order for the death of Husayn. The actual perpetrator of the deed, which was accomplished by beheading, was Shimr Ibn-i-Dhi'l-Jawshan.

See Qur'án, 20.106.

The tenor of this and the preceding sentence is reminiscent of Qur'án, 3.169.

Cf. the exclamation attributed to Mírzá Áqá Ján in the Tablet to Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad the Afnán quoted near the beginning of this section: "O beloved of mine heart! A hundred thousand blessings be theirs, and a hundred thousand regrets the portion of this servant! Methinks, with the tongues of the whole world he exclaimeth at all times: '*Would I had been with them!*'"

The identity of the addressee is not at present known.*

It will be recalled that Bahá'u'lláh was described in the opening invocation of one of the preceding Tablets in this section as "the One that Speaketh before the Divine Countenance."

i.e., presumably, the King of Martyrs.*

Corroborating the statement in an earlier Tablet: "Till now, well nigh a hundred Tablets have been revealed touching this supreme calamity; nay more, inasmuch as it is observed that in these days too mention is made of the martyrs in some of the Tablets."

The following Verse occurs in the Mathnavíy-i-Mubárak (line 185), a mystic poem composed by Bahá'u'lláh during the period of His sojourn in Constantinople.

As stated in previous Tablets in this section: i) "Say: This is a sacrifice whose effects have penetrated the world. Erelong shall God make them manifest through the power of truth; potent is He to do whatsoever He willeth." and ii) "Know further: That which hath come to pass shall exert an influence in the world: erelong shall this become apparent through the sovereignty of God, the Almighty, the Most Powerful."

i.e., presumably, Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, the father of the Twin Shining Lights, concerning whom the author had stated in Section One above: "Numerous Blessed Tablets were revealed in his honour by the Pen of the Ancient Beauty, transcriptions of some of which are included in the sixth section of this book."*

The addressee is again assumed to be Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím, whose name (which, as mentioned, is the Arabic form of Abraham) then suggests the allegorical identification of Bahá'u'lláh in the following sentence with the eponymous Abraham -- His own Forbear and the "Father of the Faithful."*

"Bahá'u'lláh Himself, as attested by Nabil in his narrative, had, as far back as the first years of His banishment to Adrianople, alluded to that same city in His Lawh-i-Sayyáh, designating it as the 'Vale of Nabil,' the word Nabil being equal in numerical value to that of 'Akká. 'Upon Our arrival,' that Tablet had predicted, 'We were welcomed with banners of light, whereupon the Voice of the Spirit cried out saying: "Soon will all that dwell on earth be enlisted under these banners."'"---*God Passes By*, p. 184

The language of the Tablet here changes from Arabic to Persian.

See Qur'án, 55.26-28.

See Qur'án, 20.47.

i.e. Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, the eldest son of the Beloved of Martyrs.

The same Tablet (with some slight differences of wording) was provided in full in Section Two above.*

Varying from the previous wording of the Tablet: "wisdom and utterance are His estate."*

i.e. the promise of attainment to the Divine presence on the Day of God.

Varying from the previous wording of the Tablet: "He, verily, beareth witness that thou hast attained unto the promised reunion."*

*Balmá'*: the night of the full moon.

Presumably Hájí Abu'l-Hasan Amín-i-Ardikání, Hand of the Cause, Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh, and second Trustee of the Huqúqu'lláh.*

See Qur'án, 11.103.

Cf. Qur'án, 85. 2.

i.e. the enigma of how a day of "return," which is how the Day of Judgment is predominantly conceived, could at the same time be -- as it is according to the Bahá'í point of view -- a day of "beginning" anew.

i.e., presumably, that of *knowledge*, as is twice stated in the Kitáb-i-Íqán (pp. 69 & 188).

The "Secret Steeped in Mystery" (*As-Sirru'l-Mustasirr*), and various similar expressions, are of very frequent occurrence in the Qayyúmu'l-Asmá', the Báb's commentary on the Súrih of Joseph.

Presumably a reference to the drastic farmán of Sultán 'Abdu'l-'Azíz, dated 5 Rabí'u'th-Thání 1285 (26 July 1868), forbidding the exiles freedom of association (see *God Passes By*, p. 186).

Recalling the Qur'ánic formula, often quoted in the preceding: "Verily, we are God's, and unto Him shall we return."

i.e. the initial loop of the letter Sád (**ص**) which resembles in its shape the human eye -- the latter then providing, in Arabic as in English, a figure for a spring or fountain. "He alone \sc. Bahá'u'lláh\ was the Object of that prodigious eulogy, that masterly interpretation of the Sád of Samad \see Qur'án, 112.2\, penned in part, in that same Fort by that same youthful hero, under the most distressing circumstances, and equivalent in dimensions to six times the volume of the Qur'án."---*God Passes By*, p. 69

"No land remained which did not drink the blood of these embodiments of detachment, and no sword that did not bruise their necks."---The Kitáb-i-Íqán, p. 224

sc. no matter how unjust.

"Their deeds, alone, testify to the truth of their words."---The Kitáb-i-Íqán, p. 224

As will later become apparent, the Tablet is once more ostensibly in the voice of Bahá'u'lláh's amanuensis, Mírzá Áqá Ján, although this distinction becomes blurred in its final portion.

The identity of the recipient of this magnificent Tablet is not at present known. All that can be assumed is that in question is a relative of the Twin Shining Lights.*

The language of the Tablet changes at this point from Arabic to Persian.

sc. on the part of Mírzá Áqá Ján, as is expressly stated a little further on.

i.e. the present Tablet, with its magnificent Arabic exordium, unexampled by any other piece in the present collection.

sc. connected with the manner of its delivery, not the nature of its contents.

See Qur'án, 2.155; quoted in *The Dawn-Breakers*, p. 356.

Cf. "O YE SONS OF SPIRIT! Ye are My treasury, for in you I have treasured the pearls of My mysteries and the gems of My knowledge. Guard them from the strangers amidst My servants and from the ungodly amongst My people."---Arabic Hidden Words, No. 69

Echoing Qur'án, 36.26; cf. also the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 36.

The voice of Mírzá Áqá Ján seems at this point to become indistinguishably merged with that of Bahá'u'lláh -- a change already heralded by the repeated use of propositions introduced by "Say:" in the opening Arabic preamble. The circumstance provides another proof -- if such were needed -- that all Tablets ostensibly in his voice have in reality been dictated to him, and in his persona, by the Blessed Beauty.

Reaffirming the statement earlier in the Tablet: "Thou well knowest that they have harboured no purpose in Thy realm except to eradicate sedition from among Thy servants; to adorn their bodies with the robes of love and unity; and to crown their heads with the diadems of harmony and affection."

See Qur'án, 12.87: words spoken by Jacob in bidding his sons go in search of Joseph and Benjamin.

Other than that the recipient of the Tablet is a male, his identity is not at present known.*

i.e. the daughter of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, eldest son of the Beloved of Martyrs, through his second wife, Túbá Khánum, the grand-daughter of Mishkín-Qalam.

i.e. the eldest daughter of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq through his first wife, Sakínih Begum, the daughter of the King of Martyrs. 'Abdu'l-Bahá indicates that He is writing at the instance of the two step-sisters, either in response to a letter, or -- more likely -- a spoken request made during a visit to the Holy Land.*

The identity of the recipient of the Tablet is not at present known.*

i.e. Mishkín-Qalam and Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, as becomes apparent from the Tablet. The same Tablet (with some slight differences of wording) was provided in full in Section Two above.*

i.e., specifically, to Adrianople, in order to attain the presence of Bahá'u'lláh.

A reference to Mishkín-Qalam's incarceration at the hands of the Turkish authorities prior to his expulsion from Istanbul to Gallipoli: see *Memorials of the Faithful*, p. 100.

The Turkish seaport, commanding the entrance to the Straits of the Dardanelles, to which, together with His companions, Bahá'u'lláh was directed to proceed preparatory to His fourth and final exile.

Varying from the previous wording of the Tablet: "the just state -- that is to say, the English government."*

i.e. Central Asia, the home of the Turks (cf. the following note on Kay-Khusraw).

Varying from the previous wording of the Tablet: "It bore the words 'Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!' When my gaze fell upon the Greatest Name, occupying as it did the place of honour in the room of this great personage, I was all at once overcome by a feeling of tremendous joy and happiness."*

i.e. Mishkín and Sádiq (the epithets are the same as those used at the outset of the Tablet).

Varying from the previous wording of the Tablet: "under the shadow of God's loving providence, and in the shelter of His protection."*

Varying from the previous wording of the Tablet: "that ye may follow their example, and be worthy offspring of those illustrious forbears."*

One of the Kayanids; descended, through his mother Princess Farangís of Túrán, from Afrásíyáb, and, through his father Síyávash, from Kay-Kávús, who chose him as his heir on the throne of Írán.

Varying from the previous wording of the Tablet, which concluded with the signature: "'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás, 4 Sha'bán 1339, Haifa."*

The name is given rather as "Farah-Angíz" in the previous version of the Tablet (as also in the facsimile version of the Tablet at the end of the volume). Perhaps Farah-Angíz adopted this close "doublet" of her name in view of the implicit allusion to Princess Farangís in the quoted verse from the Sháh-Námih.*

Varying in numerous points from the address data previously provided (at the *outset* of the Tablet), which had, for example, named the city of residence, and included Túbá Khánum among the addressees.*

Reminiscent of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's characterization of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, in the prayer for forgiveness He revealed in his honour (see Section Two above), as "this exalted offshoot of the tree of Supreme Sacrifice," suggesting perhaps that the present Tablet is addressed to his offspring.*

Notwithstanding the resemblance of the terms of this description to those in which Mishkín-Qalam is portrayed above ("He was the incarnation of spirit and the embodiment of light"), it seems that the one intended in the present case is the addressees' *grandfather*, the Beloved of Martyrs.*

i.e. to be the goodliest of fruits.

Evidently Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq's two sons from his second wife Túbá Khánum.*

The referent of the name is not at present known.*

Apparently the addressee's grandmother.*

22 November 1921: *revealed just six days before His passing, this must have been one of the last Tablets the Master revealed*.

Again reminiscent of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's characterization of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq, in the prayer for forgiveness He revealed for him, as "this exalted offshoot of the tree of Supreme Sacrifice."

It is not at present known whose passing is here referred to: possibly that of Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq.*

i.e. (as 'Abdu'l-Bahá states in numerous Tablets) after the passing of Bahá'u'lláh the next world has become so much more desirable an abode than this present one, that life down here is tantamount to a living death, while death in this world is by contrast the portal to a life of unimaginable fullness.

Although it is not known which particular Verse might here be intended, the context makes clear that it must be of a similar tenor to 'Abdu'l-Bahá's statement, in a Tablet depicting the bounty of becoming the object of trials and afflictions for the sake of God: "... his honour the Beloved of Martyrs found in the scene of sacrifice the *Most Great Glad Tidings*; ..."---*Makátíb*, Vol. 6, p. 128. Significantly, one of the Tablets to the King of Martyrs presented in Section Four above concludes with the assurance that a "great glad tidings" had been destined for him: "Rejoice then in thy spirit inasmuch as We have answered thee, and made mention of thee, in this Tablet, and ordained for thee a *great glad tidings* on the part of God."*

sc. as represented in particular by the apparent calamity of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights.

The invocation alludes to the subject's father's designation as the "*Beloved* of Martyrs."

The change of grammatical mood is as in the original.

sc. in the way of altering, overriding, circumventing, it etc.

For these various stipulations, see (on maturity) Questions and Answers, Items 20 & 92; (on betrothal) Q & A, Item 43; and (on consent) the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Paragraph 65, and Q & A Item 92.

The third and youngest son of the Beloved of Martyrs (see Section Two above).

See Qur'án, 89.28: the words are often quoted on Muslim tombstones, and indeed on many of the graves in the Bahá'í cemetery in Haifa.

Cf. Qur'án, 54.55 (the last Verse of the Súrih).

i.e. 22 Jamádíyu'th-Thání.

11 July 1909.

The Tablet was evidently revealed for Fátimih Begum on the occasion of a bereavement, possibly that of her brother Áqá Mírzá Ahmad, who, as is apparent from the information provided about him in Section Two above, left a young family behind him at the time of his passing. Most of the Tablet has already been quoted in that section. In the context of this present section, the Tablet should perhaps be relocated to follow on immediately after the two preceding Tablets addressed to Fátimih Begum.*

Varying from the previous wording of the Tablet: "... truly beloved, praiseworthy and desirable, ..."*

Varying from the previous wording of the Tablet: "... calamities suffered in the path of the True One are a bounty; ..."*

i.e. (assuming the deceased to have been Áqá Mírzá Ahmad) Tal'at.*

Indicating that the deceased left young ones, and so raising the presumption that in question is Mírzá Ahmad, whose wife Tal'at 'Abdu'l-Bahá likewise counselled in similar terms (see Section Two above).*

Assuming that this passage is the personal remark appended by Shoghi Effendi to the following letter, the addressee is Rúhá Khánum, some of whose services are there set forth. It is recommended that these items be presented in the same format as the previously-quoted letter on the Guardian's behalf to Rúhá Khánum, dated 19 June 1933 (see Section Three above), where Shoghi Effendi's addition had been placed *after* the body of the letter, preceded by the explanation "(Written in the Guardian's own hand)."*

The same to whom the remarkable Tablet of the Master, *revealed just six days before His passing*, was addressed: here referred to by her married name of Maghzí rather than her maiden name of Mahbúbí.

Apparently the addressee's grandmother.*

Presumably Rúhá Khánum's sister.*

Ridváníyyih Khánum and Munavvar Khánum are presumably the *cousins* of the addressee, daughters of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí and Liqá'íyyih Khánum, and, like her, grand-daughters of the Beloved of Martyrs. However, because Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí married his first cousin once removed, they stand to the subject simultaneously in the relation of *second cousins once remove*d.*

Presumably the addressee's daughter. The assembly appears to have numbered 9 members all told.*

Otherwise known as a hubble-bubble or a hookah pipe.

sc. and thus rendered unfit for use by other parties: in social gatherings throughout the Middle East it is normal for one or more narghiles to be provided for the use of the company, no further regard being had for hygiene than a perfunctory wipe of the mouthpiece each time one of them changes hands.

One of four penalties prescribed in the Qur'án for those who wage war against God and His Prophet, and who wreak mischief in the land; see 5.33.

Presumably the Maydán-i-Naqsh-i-Jihán, or Maydán-i-Sháh, mentioned in Section Three above.

13 February 1879.

According to the Eastern usage, the fortieth day after someone's passing is held to mark the end of the period of official mourning: "During the week following His \sc. 'Abdu'l-Bahá's\ passing, from fifty to a hundred of the poor of Haifa were daily fed at His house, whilst on the seventh day corn was distributed in His memory to about a thousand of them irrespective of creed or race. *On the fortieth day* an impressive memorial feast was held in His memory, to which over six hundred of the people of Haifa, 'Akká and the surrounding parts of Palestine and Syria, including officials and notables of various religions and races, were invited. More than one hundred of the poor were also fed on that day."---*God Passes By,* p. 313

i.e., as mentioned, after completion of the designated period for crucifixion in Islamic law.

A punishment also recorded to have been inflicted on slaves in the West.

Mullá Muhammad-'Alí of Qá'in, an account of whom is provided in *Memorials of the Faithful* (to be distinguished from the Hand of the Cause and Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh, Muhammad-i-Qá'iní, surnamed "Nabíl-i-Akbar," concerning whom see the first account provided in *Memorials of the Faithful*).

Hájí Abu'l-Hasan Amín-i-Ardikání, Hand of the Cause, Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh, and second Trustee of the Huqúqu'lláh -- the same already referred to in Sections Two (twice) and Six above.

The "fourth" of those unnamed "four souls" for whom, as Bahá'u'lláh mentions in the first of His two Tablets to Samandar quoted in Section Five above, "there hath been sent down from the heaven of God's loving-kindness that which hath changed the world's happiness into grief."

The paraphrase has been retained for the sake of verisimilitude to the original, which does not purport to provide a strict translation; for the actual wording, see *God Passes By*, p. 201 (quoted in the notes to Section Five above in connection with the aforesaid passage touching the unnamed "four souls").

A small agricultural town in the present-day province of South Khurásán: chiefly famous in Bahá'í history as the home of Mullá Husayn, the Bábu'l-Báb (Gate of the Gate).

A city some 30 kilometres to the west of Isfahán, chiefly famous in Bahá'í history as the home of Mullá Zaynu'l-'Ábidín, named by Bahá'u'lláh "Zaynu'l-Muqarrabín" ("Ornament of the Near Ones"): one of His nineteen Apostles, and the foremost *scribe*, as distinct from *amanuensis*, of the Bahá'í Dispensation.

Year commencing 28 August 1889.

The Barber: one of the companions of Bahá'u'lláh, mentioned on p. 166 of *God Passes By*.

Year commencing 25 February 1906.

"Historians have stated that he was illiterate and claim that his autobiography was dictated by him. One thing, however, is clear: that even if he had barely learnt to read and write, he had no education whatsoever."--- Adíb Taherzadeh, *The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh*, Vol. II, p. 155

A punishment also recorded to have been inflicted on slaves in the West.

In reference to Qur'án, 41.53: "We will show them Our signs in the horizons and in their own selves, ...;" quoted in the Bahá'í Writings as "We will surely show them Our signs in the world and within themselves." The distinction is essentially between the realms of the *visible* and the *invisible*.

Year commencing 30 March 1903.

One of the first four Hands of the Cause, Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh, and accomplished littérateur.

The Finance Minister ("Vazír") of Zillu's-Sultán.

The "Paymaster-general" (a military title).

The Jalálí Regiment, so named in honour of Zillu's-Sultán's son Mahmúd, surnamed the "Jalálu'd-Dawlih" (see the notes on "Afváj" in Section Three above, and "Jalálu'd-Dawlih" in Section Eight below).

i.e. the aforesaid Mírzá Asadu'lláh Khán, Finance Minister of Zillu's-Sultán.

Location of a famous bridge in the westernmost part of the city.

Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alí sets the number of martyrs rather at 70: "Then as the Friends of God proceeded to their homes, the malicious multitude attacked them on the streets, capturing and beating them. Whomever they found, they tortured and wounded, in all seventy people, killing some outright. // Siyyid Abu'l-Qásim-i- Márnání was one of the martyrs. This beautiful soul was about eighty years of age, and during his life was renowned for his piety, faith, knowledge and virtue; even his enemies bore record to his chastity and sanctity, testifying to his generosity and charity. He was in truth a help to the poor, refuge and support for the suffering and afflicted; his word was influential, honoured and accepted by all the people. When they assaulted him he cried out: 'Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá! We are from God and unto Him we are returning,' and in the very moment of his expiration he called out in a loud voice with great joy and exultation these words: 'You have done us no harm! You are only transmitting us to our Lord! Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!' // While his tormentors, like wild beasts, were stoning him and chopping him with axes, this single, helpless man of such venerable years, this holy soul, under the weapons of the persecutors, wounding and cursing him, suffered it all with a fortitude of grandeur and majesty, facing the Kingdom of Light as though he felt not a blow nor received a wound, but was rather perceiving the open gates of the Supreme Concourse, and yielded his life to his Beloved with utmost joy, happiness and exhilaration. // O that I had been with him to partake of his joy and to attain his great happiness!"---from the account of "recent martyrdoms in Persia, up to the present time" written by the author "in compliance to the holy command of 'Abdu'l-Bahá;" issued by the Bahá'í Publishing Trust in Chicago in Persian in 1904, and thereafter in an English translation by Dr. Yúnis Khán-i-Afrúkhtih in 1917, and currently available on the "Bahá'í Library Online" website under the title "Bahá'í Martyrdoms in Persia in the Year 1903 A.D."

"The Garden of the Wild Pine:" one of the many historical gardens of Isfahán.

Presumably a reference to the passing of Bahá'u'lláh eight hours after sunset on 29 May 1892.

For, as mentioned in Section Three above, the Afváj, of which this was one, were composed of levies.

i.e., presumably, to Tálkhúnchih, in view of his father's association with Mullá Sálih, a "native" of that village, suggesting that the basis of their acquaintance may have been as fellow-residents.

The "Mosque of the Sháh" or "Royal Mosque," now known as the "Imám Mosque:" the great mosque overlooking the Maydán-i-Sháh on the south side, accounted one of the glories of Persian architecture.

Shaykh Muhammad-Taqíy-i-Najafí, the "Son of the Wolf."

Confirming the connection of the author's family with the town of Tálkhúnchih.

i.e. Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir the "Wolf."

i.e. Mír Muhammad-Husayn the "She-Serpent."

This blessed utterance was revealed in a Tablet that issued from the pen of the Centre of the Covenant -- exalted be His praise -- after the martyrdom of Hájí Kalb-'Alíy-i-Najaf-Ábádí in honour of his surviving family members. (Ishráq-Khávarí) The punishment evoked alludes to the martyr's name of "Kalb," which denotes in Arabic a dog -- as though with the intention that it should thereby be fitted to the offence.

See the note on the subject in the introduction.

The same referred to in the introduction: the epithet "Násirí" merely associates the volume with the reign of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh.

In Persian, *Zill-i-Zá'il* (playing on his title "Zillu's-Sultán," signifying "Shadow of the Sovereign").

"The Sealed Wine:" the author's encyclopaedic companion to the Guardian's "Lawh-i-Qarn," his extensive centennial letter of 101 B.E. to the Persian friends, which corresponds roughly to *God Passes By*.

The work *Rahíq-i-Makhtúm* takes in fact the form of a dictionary, wherein the information is arranged under "headwords" derived from significant or unfamiliar expressions in the letter, of which this is one.

i.e. not, as his son would have him believe, the Bahá'ís.

The same mentioned in Section Two above; see the note on him there.

sc. consisting in his enlisting the support of the Bahá'ís for Zillu's-Sultán's pretensions to the throne, in return for which they would be granted official recognition in Írán, as is explained more fully hereafter.

i.e. Zillu's-Sultán, whose misrepresentations of the Faith to the Sháh, prompted by disappointment over not receiving Bahá'í support for his scheme, induced the latter to accord him special powers, thereby sanctioning some of the persecutions that he might not otherwise have been prepared to countenance.

The Amu Darya and the Syr Darya of more modern times: the two great rivers of Central Asia, both flowing from the Aral Sea.

i.e. 9 Jamádíyu'l-Avval.

11 December 1891: the identity of the recipient of the Tablet is not at present known.*

i.e. *God Passes By*.

The eldest son of Zillu's-Sultán, who was later to apologize profusely to 'Abdu'l-Bahá for the wrongs he had committed: "... the sight of Jalálu'd-Dawlih, fallen prostrate at His feet, profuse in his apologies and imploring His forgiveness for his past iniquities; ..."---*God Passes By,* p. 291

i.e. Yazd.

The paraphrase has been retained for the sake of verisimilitude to the original, which does not purport to provide a strict translation.

The "Administrator of the Divines:" title of Hájí Mullá Mahmúd, the tutor to Prince Násiri'd-Dín when the latter was governor of Ádhirbáyján, who presided over the historic gathering of religious dignitaries of Tabríz, convoked at the instance of the Grand Vizir, and held in the official residence of the governor himself, at which the Báb pronounced in "ringing tones" His claim to be the Promised One of Islám.

i.e. of 'Abdu'l-Bahá: Zillu's-Sultán gracelessly, and perhaps unwittingly, reveals that this would be a source of embarrassment to him.

The month is omitted from the text.*

Draconian governor of 'Iráq under the Umayyads (born: 661; died 714).

The title introduces another entry from the author's aforesaid *Rahíq-i-Makhtúm*.

sc. in the author's aforesaid *Rahíq-i-Makhtúm*.*

At present no data information is available concerning this extract.*

The identity of the addressee is not at present known: possibly Hájí Mírzá Habíbu'lláh.*

The passage makes clear that at the time of the revelation of this Tablet the Wolf had not yet died of his malady; so confirming, when taken in conjunction with the foregoing remarks concerning the She-Serpent that, as suggested in the notes to Section Five above, *the latter did indeed predecease the former*.*

i.e. the Ottoman Grand Vizir 'Álí Páshá, as already noted in Section Five above.

See the sixth of the nine "Delights" ("*Bihjat*") of which the book is composed, p. 222.

Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alí, who is quoting from memory, slightly changes the wording from its original form: "Ere long will the breaths of chastisement seize thee, as they seized others before thee. Wait, O thou who hast joined partners with God, the Lord of the visible and the invisible." (See the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 101; *Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas*, p. 214; and below.)

Presumably 'Ubaydu'lláh the son of Zíyád Ibn-i-Abí-Hi, mentioned in Section Three above.

The paraphrase has been retained for the sake of verisimilitude to the original, which does not purport to provide a strict translation.

Year commencing 18 February 1874.

In fact the statement is made of the *Wolf*: "We visited the *Wolf* with an agony inconceivable to all but God, the Lord of the worlds; and this was in the first year after he opposed My Name Há'."*

Year commencing 4 December 1880. The second year after the death of the Twin Shining Lights coincides in fact more nearly with 1297, since the martyrdom occurred in the *first quarter* of 1296: however, in *Khátirát-i-Muhájirí az Isfahán*, Áqá Husayn-'Alí Núr is quoted as stating that the Imám-Jum'ih returned from exile to Isfahán -- ere contracting his fatal illness -- *two years after that event* (p. 50).*

It is not at present known what particular sufferings are here alluded to.*

It may be recalled that, as related in Section One above, the grandfather of Khánum Díyá', the King of Martyrs, had received a Tablet from Bahá'u'lláh announcing to him, in reference to the imminent marriage of his cousin Fátimih Khánum to the Greatest Branch: "Such is the Divine grace vouchsafed unto you that He hath appointed you members of the Holy Family and relations of the One True God."

i.e. Mírzá 'Ináyatu'lláh-i-Isfahání, the husband of Khánum Díyá' (see Section Two above).

These latter words are added as a postscript to the body of the letter.

Shaykh Muhammad-Taqíy-i-Najafí , the "Son of the Wolf:" mentioned respectively by the longer and shorter designations in Sections Three and Seven above.

Said originally of Malik Ashraf, one of the Shepherd Kings of Ádhirbáyján, whose inordinate greed for gold and silver, and ruthlessness in extorting it from his people to the utter neglect of the conduct of affairs of state, led eventually to his, and the dynasty's, downfall, whence he lost both *name* and *fortune*.

A practice forbidden by Bahá'u'lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: see Paragraph 34.

See the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Paragraph 41.

See Qur'án, 62.5. The quotation differs slightly from the wording of the original, which reads: "*The likeness of* those who were charged with the Torah, then bore it not, *is as that of* an ass laden with books ..." The sense appears to be in general that those who burden themselves with punctilious observance of the outward forms of religion, without however comprehending its informing spirit and animating purpose, are like nothing so much as brute unreasoning beasts of burden freighted down with books.

This in conformity with the Qur'ánic advice to pass by mockery and ridicule in dignified silence: "... and those who bear not false witness, and who, if they pass by raillery, do so with dignity" (25.71); cf. also 23.3 and 28.55.

i.e. Siyyid Sadru'd-Dín-i-Dirakhshán, presumably also on the authority of his father Hujjatu'l-Islám Áqá Siyyid Javád.*

The anecdote is scurrilous, for it is intended to portray Áqá Najafí as a "*pidar-súkhtih*," signifying literally one whose father is burning in Hell, but similar in tone and effect to English "bastard."

i.e. the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf.

This term adventitious to the officially approved wording of the text.*

See Qur'án, 4.94; quoted also in *Gleanings*, Selection CXIII, p. 225.

The pronoun reverts back to "Our eyes."

See Qur'án, 2.88: the significance of this Verse as appointing a "touchstone of sincerity" is highlighted also in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, p. 227-8, and the Súriy-i-Haykal (Tablet to Násiri'd-Dín Sháh, Paragraph 222).

i.e. 'Abdu'l-'Azíz; the reigning Sultán at the time of the revelation of this Tablet was 'Abdu'l-Hamíd II.

i.e. the French Emperor Napoleon III.

Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir is here implicitly likened to Pharaoh, whose expressed intention to put Moses to death elicited the following expostulation from a believing member of his household.

See Qur'án, 40.28.

i.e. the friends should refrain from recrimination over adversities sustained in the Cause.

Cf. the similar series of prudential admonitions in Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet to Samandar above: "Be thou stablished upon the throne of wisdom; walk thou in the way of wisdom; and cleave thou unto the cord of wisdom: thus biddeth thee the Lord of all creation; He, verily, is the Faithful Counsellor."

Cf. Qur'án, 21.46.

i.e. Adrianople, the numerical value of whose Turkish name, Edirne, in the Arabic script (**ادرنه**) is equivalent to that of the Arabic word "*Sirr*" (**سر**), signifying "Mystery" -- viz. 260.

i.e., presumably, the Lawh-i-Ra'ís: the title "Ra'ís" ("Chief") seems in this authorized translation of the Lawh-i-Burhán (*Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas*, p. 213) to have been applied to the Turkish Sultán, rather than his Grand Vizir 'Álí Páshá, with whom it is more generally identified.*

This phrase does not occur in the authorized version of the Tablet.*

The name of the She-Wolf's brother, Mír Siyyid Muhammad, attests a holy lineage.

Cf. the similar passage in the Tablet addressed to Javád in Section Five above: "Say: Was it Hasan who disbelieved in God, or was it that which he possessed? If it was he, why then didst thou pillage his possessions, O thou false dissembler?"

i.e. slain the older generation, and deprived the younger of the property that would have been theirs.

i.e. if He can raise the She-Camel of Sálih, a mere beast, to so high a station, then assuredly He can do the same in the case of the King and the Beloved of Martyrs, whose martyrdom has been explicitly likened in previously quoted Tablets to the hamstringing of that creature by the Prophet's people Thamúd.

A Tablet was revealed in honour of Abu'l-Fadá'il, author of the work *Fará'id*, in the form of a prayer from the pen of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- may the life of all else be a sacrifice unto Him. *His most sweet utterance:* "Alláh-u-Abhá! O Thou Glory of the Most Glorious! I have wakened on this Naw-Rúz morning to find the lights of Thy holiness gleaming from all regions, the verses of Thy unity recited by the tongues of all things, and the tokens of Thy singleness evident in the scroll of the Book of Creation. Blessed is he who chanteth them in such accents as to fill with ecstasy the Concourse on high, and to reach the ears of the dwellers of the Abhá Kingdom. Glorified then be my Lord, the Most High! When, O my God, I had taken my station facing the Spot around which circle those that are nigh unto Thee, lo, there was before me a written letter, a guarded tablet, and an outspread roll containing cogent proofs, clear testimonies and lucid evidences in refutation of one who had striven to repudiate Thy truth. O God! Assist Thou its author through the confirmations of Thine Abhá Kingdom; strengthen his loins by Thine almighty power; cause him to utter Thy praises in great assemblies; and make him Thy most mighty sign, a compelling proof in vindication of Thy Cause among all peoples, a resplendent sign in the world of creation, a standard raised above the pavilions of sublimest glory, a matchless pearl and a peerless jewel glittering in the diadem of loftiness. O my Lord! Illumine his countenance with the lights shining from the Abhá Kingdom, and the rays dawning from the Most Exalted Horizon, inasmuch as he hath served Thy Cause, published Thy testimony, manifested Thine evidence, elucidated Thy path, and adorned the leaves of utterance with the verses of Thy unity. Thou, verily, art the Bestower, the Compassionate. 'Ayn 'Ayn" Abu'l-Fadá'il was born in the year 1260 A.H. \c. 1844\, and became a believer in the Blessed Cause in the year of the revelation of the Lawh-i-Ra'ís and the Lawh-i-Káf-Zá' \Tablet of Kázim ([Shaykh Kázim-i-Samandar)\], which arrived in Írán by the hand of Dhabíh-i-Káshání, pursuant to witnessing the fulfilment of the matters foretold in these Tablets. He suffered innumerable vicissitudes, being imprisoned in 1300 A.H. \c. 1883\ along with the rest of the friends by order of Kámrán Mírzá, the governor of Tihrán, at which time strangers and enemies bore off all his possessions. Thereafter he embarked on a series of teaching trips, in the course of which he travelled widely, visiting many different places in Írán, Russia, Turkistán and Ádhirbáyján, and was for long engaged in diffusing the Divine fragrances in Bukhárá. In the end he settled down in Egypt, from whence, at the blessed behest of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, he undertook a trip to America. In this manner he remained occupied with service to the Cause of God until finally in Egypt, in the month of Safar, 1332 A.H. \c. January 1914\, he ascended to the Abhá Kingdom. At first he was buried in the house of Hájj Mírzá Hasan; then later his most pure corse was transferred to the Eternal Rose Garden of Egypt. His writings are well-known; his station is remembered before God; and he was the recipient of numerous Tablets from the pen of the Ancient Beauty, as well as of countless favours from His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá. After his passing, the late Fasíhu'l-Mulk, Shúrídiy-i-Shírází, who died in 1345 A.H. \1926-7\, and is accounted an eloquent writer and a honey-tongued poet alike of the reign of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh and of the more recent era, and who was moreover one of the faithful friends and believers in the Blessed Cause, composed the following verses concerning the date of Abu'l-Fadá'il's passing: "In one thousand three hundred and thirty-two * Bu'l-Fadl in Safar to the world beyond sped. // If the same in the Abjad count be expressed: * *Lo: Bu'l-Fadl beheld spring, breathed his last, then fled.*" (The final hemistich of the two couplets has been so ingeniously composed in Persian that the numerical values of its constituent letters according to the Abjad system add up precisely to the year of the subject's passing in 1332: "*Bu'l-Fadl bín kih díd bahárá-u-dád ján:*" \Bá' = 2\ + \Váv = 6\ + \Alif = 1\ + \Lám = 30\ + \Fá' = 80\ + \Dád = 800\ + \Lám = 30\ + \Bá' = 2\ + \Yá' = 10\ + \Nún = 50\ + \Káf = 20\ + \Há' = 5\ + \Dál = 4\ + \Yá' = 10\ + \Dál = 4\ + \Bá' = 2\ + \Há' = 5\ + \Alif = 1\ + \Rá' = 200\ + \Alif = 1\ + \Váv = 6\ + \Dál = 4\ + \Alif = 1\ + \Dál = 4\ + \Jím = 3\ + \Alif = 1\ + \Nún = 50\ = ***1332***. The same effect has also been produced in the English rendering, the numerical values of whose last hemistich add up to the equivalent in the Gregorian calendar of the year of Abu'l-Fadl's passing, as follows: "*Lo: Bu'l-Fadl beheld spring, breathed his last, then fled:*" \L = 30\ + \O = 60\ + \Β = 2\ + \U = 300\ + \L = 30\ + \F = 6\ + \Α = 1\ + \D = 4\ + \L = 30\ + \Β = 2\ + \Ε = 5\ + \Η = 8\ + \Ε = 5\ + \L = 30\ + \D = 4\ + \S = 100\ + \P = 70\ + \R = 90\ + \I = 9\ + \N = 50\ + \G = 7\ + \B = 2\ + \R = 90\ + \E = 5\ + \A = 1\ + \T = 200\ + \H = 8\ + \E = 5\ + \D = 4\ + \H = 8\ + \I = 9\ + \S = 100\ + \L = 30\ + \A = 1\ + \S = 100\ + \T = 200\ + \T = 200\ + \H = 8\ + \E = 5\ + \N = 50\ + \F = 6\ + \L = 30\ + \E + 5\ + \D = 4\ = ***1914***.) After the passing of Abu'l-Fadá'il, detailed descriptions of the greatness of his station flowed from the most pure tongue of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá -- exalted be His praise -- which are recorded and available in their appropriate places. The late Malkum Khán, who was a well-known Iranian statesman, inquired of Abu'l-Fadá'il concerning the attempted shooting of Násiri'd-Dín Sháh by the Bábís, in reply to which the latter composed a lengthy treatise wherein he expatiated upon the history of the Faith and its blessed teachings. It was in this treatise that he provided his description of the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights. Since the subject of Mírzá Malkum Khán has arisen, it is pertinent to record that reference has been made to him in the Tablets issuing from the blessed pen of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá; among them a Tablet concerning Malkum Khán in which He says: *His most sweet utterance:* "In this world thousands of statesmen have come and gone -- men who on earth were responsible for exceedingly important publications, but of whom no mention or trace now remains. Malkum Khán -- upon whom be God's mercy and good pleasure -- occupied himself for fifty years with political publications, filled Írán with the newspaper 'Qánún,' and became a catalyst for initiating new thoughts. In the end others entered the arena, raised a great tumult, and the efforts of fifty years, the homelessness, the wanderings, all came to this, that at the time of his final illness, however much he wrote and begged that at least one among his Iranian companions might be present at the time of his passing so as to hear that hapless wanderer's last wishes, it was not to be. Finally, in the utmost despair and hopelessness, and vexation with his friends, he passed away. Upon him be the mercy of God. In truth, the poor man was deprived of high position, the title 'Nizámu'd-Dawlih,' and glory and popularity in Írán, while in the political world he neither secured gain, nor reaped fruit, nor obtained that name which was the utmost object of his hopes. Disappointed and sorrowful, he departed from this world, while the Republicans one and all consider themselves greater than he ..." *Finis*. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

The same brother mentioned at the outset of the address to Ustád Kázim of Yazd which forms the concluding portion of the second Tablet to Varqá in Section Five above (see the note there provided).

Year commencing 30 March 1903.

i.e., as previously mentioned, Bahá' (Glory), whose numerical value in the Abjad system is 9.

i.e. of descent generally from the Prophet through his cousin 'Alí and daughter Fátimih, rather than specifically through one or other of the sons of these latter, Hasan and Husayn.

Salt is often invoked in connection with oaths and covenants on account of its incorruptibility.

The same addressed by Bahá'u'lláh in the following Tablet: "*Revealed for Mullá 'Alíy-i-Kandí, who ruleth in Tá' \Tihrán*: He is the Avenger, Endued with Mighty Power: O 'Alí! Muhammad the Apostle of God hath wept at thy cruelty, inasmuch as thou hast followed thy passions, and eschewed the path of guidance. Rejoice not at that which thou hast wrought: thy Lord, truly, lieth in wait. Thou hast pronounced judgment against him that believed in God in this day whereon thy face, and the faces of such as have broken the Covenant, have been darkened. The Announcer came unto you, and announced unto you the tidings of this Revelation whereby the world's horizons have been illumined; yet ye turned back from Him, even as those before you turned back when the Sun of Knowledge shone forth from the horizon of the Hijáz. God laid hold upon them for their iniquity, and left them as a sign unto all that are endowed with insight. Thinkest thou thyself a guide unto the people? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of Lords! At thy bidding hath been shed the blood of those through whom the winds have wafted, and the streams have flowed. The Holy Spirit hath bewailed them; yea, the thunder hath called out, and the cloud shed forth its tears. Fear God, and bear not thyself haughtily before Him that created thee at His bidding! Return thou unto Him lowly and repentant. Rejoicest thou at the affliction that hath overtaken Us? We have accepted it in the path of God, and, undismayed by the swords brandished against Us, summon His servants unto the Promised Day. All the peoples of the earth are powerless to prevent Us from fulfilling that whereunto thy Lord, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, hath commanded Us. Shall the dominion of the people suffice to overawe Us? Nay, by the Self of Him Who is the Sovereign Truth, even should all who are invested with power and authority rise up against Us! Hearken thou unto the words of Him that counselleth thee: shouldst thou indeed hearken, then for thine own behoof shalt thou have done so; and shouldst thou turn aside -- He, verily, is the All-Possessing, the Most High."---*Áthár-i-Qalam-i-A'lá*, Vol. 1, p. 372

17 March 1879: the actual day of the martyrdom.

i.e. Mír Siyyid Muhammad, the Sultánu'l-'Ulamá', the "great" Imám-Jum'ih (See Section Eight above), and brother of Mír Muhammad-Husayn the "She-Serpent."

The same "Áqá Najafí" mentioned in Sections Seven and Eight above.

Cf. the statement in Section Three above: "But Shaykh Muhammad-Taqíy-i-Najafí, the son of Shaykh Báqir, rolling up his sleeve amidst an assemblage of people, cried out: 'I myself am prepared to shed their blood!'"

The "Stable Hall:" formerly located to the south of the 'Álí Qápú ("Sublime Porte") palace on the west side of Naqsh-i-Jihán square, but now no longer in existence. In *Khátirát-i-Muhájirí az Isfahán* it is noted that the Tálár-i-Tavílih served at this time as a prison for notables (p. 16).

i.e., presumably, in the central square, as mentioned in Section Three above.

A variant form of Takhtih-Fúlád.

In *Khátirát-i-Muhájirí az Isfahán* it is stated that Zillu's-Sultán granted Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl permission to lay the bodies to rest somewhere in return for a handsome payment (p. 37).*

Who dwelt in this world for more than seventy years, and, after accepting the Blessed Cause, rendered befitting services to the Faith of God. Pursuant to the command of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, he undertook a trip to America, upon returning from which he was honoured to enter His blessed presence. After the passing of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Bahá, He undertook at the behest of his Holiness the Guardian of the Cause of God a further teaching trip to America. He compiled, after thirty years of diligent efforts and exertions to acquire the necessary documents and references, a history of the most exalted Cause. Finally, in this present year of 1336 A.H.S. \c. 1957\, whilst occupied with teaching the Cause in the town of Khurramshahr, in the province of Khúzistán, he ascended to the Abhá Kingdom. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

Martyrs, that is, in the manner of their lives, as well as of their deaths.

A variant of "Muhammad," both words deriving from the Semitic root "H-M-D."

It is evident from all foregoing that the King of Martyrs and Beloved of Martyrs occupy in the Bahá'í Faith a station precisely comparable to that assigned in Islám to the Prince of Martyrs, if not yet higher.

Renowned too *despite* and *thanks to*, this affiliation: cf. the following passages deriving respectively from the Tablet to Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, known as Áqá Mírzá Áqá, Núri'd-Dín; the Lawh-i-Kitábu's-Sidq (Tablet of the Book of Truth); and the second Tablet to Varqá -- all in Section Five above: i) "What greater bounty is there than this, that, praise be to God, in the nether world they were identified with the name of the True One, it being observed that even the ungodly behaved with deference in their presence; while at the end of their days they attained a station whose description is beyond aught that the pen of this servant could compass, or the tongue of this evanescent one express?" ii) "Consider now: praise be to God, so long as they lived, they were seen to occupy, through the loving-kindness of the One True God, a position of the utmost honour among His servants, love for them indeed having been instilled into people's hearts to a degree that none save God, the True One, hath ever been, or is now, able to reckon; while at the end of their days they attained unto that Supreme Sacrifice which they themselves had sought." iii) "They attained a station such that even their enemies testified to the loftiness of their rank; while at the end of their days they attained the most sublime and lofty of all stations, which is that of Supreme Sacrifice."

The correct date is 28 Jamádíyu'th-Thání 1269 (8 April 1853): see *God Passes By*, p. 109.*

The period of Bahá'u'lláh's sojourn in Baghdád cannot be accounted longer than 11 years, whether in the solar or the lunar calendars.*

Cf. the author's words in Section Three above: "Remarkably, in the famine of 1288, which afflicted the people of Írán after the martyrdom of Badí', these two brothers had shown the utmost kindness towards the people of Isfahán in general, saving a great multitude from starvation and hunger. In particular, they had lavished much kindness and assistance on a person by the name of Ramadán, who was the executioner. Yet still the people were prepared to countenance so grievous a wrong against their twin benefactors."

The parenthesis which now interposes extends all the way to the words "at such a time as this" many lines distant -- this in conformity with a prevalent literary usage of the period.

i.e. Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir the "Wolf;" the "She-Serpent" will be introduced a little later.

The emphasis which, in the Tablet to the King of Martyrs "Containing an Exhortation to Teach the Cause" cited in Section Four above, is placed on the importance of doing so *with wisdom* might seem to indicate -- what is also here suggested -- a certain tendency to pay insufficient regard to this point.

Cf. the following passages of similar import occurring in the Tablets respectively to Khalíl; to the "leaf of My Divine Lote Tree;" and to Javád -- all in Section Five above: i) "From time immemorial even until now, the Divine Lote Tree, which the hand of God's sovereign purpose hath planted in the good and blessed land, hath been watered by the blood of them that are wholly devoted to His Cause, and truly recognize His unity." ii) "Although outwardly this matter seareth the heart, yet is it, and shall it ever be, the means and cause of the growth of the Divine Lote Tree." and iii) "The groaning and lamentation of the Pen of the Most High have been, and ever shall be, in token of His loving-kindness, His grace, and His fidelity; for otherwise the Divine Lote Tree is exalted through the blood of His chosen ones." Cf. also in the same vein: iv) "Verily I say: Whatever befalleth in the path of God is the beloved of the soul and the desire of the heart. Deadly poison in His path is pure honey, and every tribulation a draught of crystal water. In the Tablet to His Majesty the Sháh it is written: 'By Him Who is the Truth! I fear no tribulation in His path, nor any affliction in My love for Him. *Verily God hath made adversity as a morning dew upon His green pasture, and a wick for His lamp which lighteth earth and heaven.*'"---Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 17; v) "Ours is the duty to raise the call of the New Day and to proclaim this Divine Message unto all people. Many a soul will, in this city \Tihrán\, shed his blood in this path. That blood will water the Tree of God, will cause it to flourish, and to overshadow all mankind."--- Mullá Husayn's parting words to Mullá Muhammad-i-Mu'allim of Núr before setting out for Khurásán.---*The Dawn Breakers*, p. 108; vi) "In the blood of the unnumbered martyrs of Persia lay the seed of the Divinely-appointed Administration which, though transplanted from its native soil, is now budding out, under your loving care, into a new order, destined to overshadow all mankind."---*The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh*, p. 52; vii) "Great is the blessedness of those whose blood Thou hast chosen wherewith to water the Tree of Thine affirmation, and thus to exalt Thy holy and immutable Word."---*Selections from the Writings of the Báb*, p. 190

Cf. the opening passage of the book: "Hasan attained unto a twofold martyrdom, for throughout the days of his life he was selfless in the Will of the One True God. Whosoever hath assimilated his will and purpose to those of his Lord and Master hath, verily, attained unto true martyrdom. He attained likewise unto an outward martyrdom. Blessed be he and his brother, and he who was called Kázim." also the following from the Tablet to 'Alí in Section Five above: "He had attained unto the true martyrdom. By My life! Years passed over him during which he was wholly selfless in the Will of his Lord, and in the Purpose of His Master. In no respect had he any thought, purpose, or will of his own; and at all times did he wait upon the Command of God. Without the leave and permission of the True One he embarked upon no enterprise. For years indeed he had already been a sacrifice in the path of the Beloved, although to outward seeming he spoke, heard, and walked like others. This is the Supreme Sacrifice, the Most Sublime Station, and the Most August Seat; and this exalted and most glorious station was crowned with outward martyrdom."

A proverbial expression indicating that a fair-seeming form may disguise a venomous interior.

sc. in token of their having been contaminated at the hands of persons branded by the Imám-Jum'ih "unclean." A similar accusation had provided also the signal for the onslaught upon Mullá Kázim-i-Tálkhúnchi'í, martyred only one month previously, as related in Section Seven above.

Identified in Section Three above as Áqá Muhammad-Báqir-i-Mudarris, the father-in-law of Zillu's-Sultán.

The official is identified in the aforesaid *Khátirát-i-Muhájirí az Isfahán*, on the authority of Áqá Husayn-'Alí Núr, as the "Náyib-i-Kull" ("Deputy-General") (p. 15).

Words represented in Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl's preceding account as: "Were his excellency to know what I know, he would not have laid upon me such a charge."

i.e. Áqá Muhammad-Báqir-i-Mudarris.

i.e. the "hubs" of that system of *haválih* transfers mentioned in Section Three above.

Colonel 'Ináyatu'lláh-i-Suhráb attributes the seizure in his reminiscences, quoted in Section Three above (see under the heading "Wealth"), rather to the *government*: "It is known that on the very day of their martyrdom there arrived in Isfahán a caravan laden with their wares, which, after it had proceeded to the Maydán-i-Naqsh-i-Jihán, known as the Maydán-i-Sháh, and its ownership been ascertained, was confiscated in its entirety by the government."*

The author states rather in Section Three above that these telegrams were sent to the Sháh: "The merchants of Isfahán ... who had transactions and dealings with those two wronged ones, and were anxious to preserve their investments, sent numerous telegrams to the Sháh of Írán, Násiri'd-Dín Sháh."*

Followed, according to the author's account in Section Three above, by numerous others: "A telegram came from the Sháh to Zillu's-Sultán instructing him to send the prisoners to Tihrán. ... Successive telegrams arrived for the governor from the Sháh, conveying in respect of the prisoners a definite recommendation that under no circumstances should they be harmed."*

Again, the main clause of the sentence is much delayed, commencing after numerous intervening subordinate clauses with the words "yet the Wolf and the She-Serpent."

i.e. the said part, not the whole sum (see the author's account in Section Three).

Since this article was written in America, the word "dollar," denoting the American currency, has been used in place of "túmán." As regards their respective valuations, the túmán stood in those days towards the dollar in a ratio of two to three, meaning that nine thousand túmáns \the sum specified in Section Three above\ were the equivalent of thirteen thousand dollars. (Ishráq-Khávarí)

The comment helps to clarify why precisely it is the younger brother who is designated as the *King* of Martyrs. One may perhaps also infer from it that he was the principal in the trading concern.

Recalling the notion expressed at various points in the preceding that martyrdom is regarded, among other things, as the highest expression of the quality of *fidelity*: the King of Martyrs, for example, appears to have been designated the "King *and* Letter of Fidelity."

Cf. the author's words in Section Three above: "In particular, they had lavished much kindness and assistance on a person by the name of Ramadán, who was the executioner;" also the following passage from Colonel 'Ináyatu'lláh-i-Suhráb's reminiscences of the Twin Shining Lights, quoted in that same section, concerning specifically their generosity: "It is known that the assistance of the two brothers was extended without distinction to all people, including even Ramadán the executioner, who was afterwards compelled to put them to death. For a while Ramadán sought by various pretexts to put off the deed, considering himself to be indebted to the two brothers for various favours they had rendered him."

According to Áqá Husayn-'Alí Núr, as cited in the aforesaid *Khátirát-i-Muhájirí az Isfahán*, the burial spot lay close to Isfahán's renowned Sí-u-Sih Pul ("Thirty-Three\-Arch\ Bridge"). This impressive structure, originally commissioned by Sháh 'Abbás I, remains to this day a major attraction of the city.

It is not at present known who was the author of this hemistich.*

Áqá Husayn-'Alí Núr is recorded in the cited volume as stating that the Imám-Jum'ih was placed by his family in a derelict room of a dilapidated house outside his own home (p. 50).*

See *Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas*, The Tablet of Ishráqát, "The Third Ishráq," p. 126.

Cf. Bahá'u'lláh's words in His Tablet to Khalíl quoted in Section Five above: "They have lit a fire whose blaze shall not be extinguished in the world."

*A Year Amongst the Persians: Impressions as to the Life, Character, & Thought of the People of Persia Received during Twelve Months' Residence in that Country in the Year 1887-1888*, by Edward Granville Browne, first published by Messrs A & C Black Ltd 1893.

For the sake of verisimilitude to the original, these extracts are rendered from the author's Persian.*

That concerning Tihrán.

See Section Seven above.

Both settlements in the vicinity of Isfahán: the former, as mentioned in Section Three above, was the birthplace of the eminent Bahá'í poet Na'ím-i-Sidihí; the latter, as mentioned in Section Seven above, was the birthplace of the "fourth" Bahá'í martyr of Isfahán, Mírzá Ashraf-i-Ábádi'í.

Moojan Momen, in an article on the Bahá'í history of Isfahán, states: "In the villages around Isfahán there were also numerous episodes of persecution and some martyrdoms: in Najaf-Ábád in 1864, 1889, 1899, and 1910; in Sidih in 1890; and in Zavárih in 1926."

The same several times referred to in Section Eight above.

Moojan Momen, in an article on the Bahá'í history of Yazd, assigns this episode rather to 1891: "From about 1290/1873 onwards the persecutions intensified. *The first culmination of this was the episode of the Seven Martyrs of Yazd in 1891.*"*

This and the previous sentence seem to misrepresent the sense of the corresponding passage in *A Year Amongst the Persians*, which is rather that the last Bábí to be killed by the Sháh's order was Mírzá Badí', whose death he decreed after the latter had delivered into his hands Bahá'u'lláh's Epistle to him, the Lawh-i-Sultán. But such a claim is itself inconsistent with 'Abdu'l-Bahá's account of the life of Shamsu'd-Duhá, quoted in Section One above, in which He definitely assigns responsibility for the martyrdom of the Twin Shining Lights to the Sháh: "Then the Sháh joined forces with those two wild animals; *and he commanded that the blood of both brothers, the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, be spilled out*."*

That concerning Isfahán.

A. L. M. Nicolas, 1864-1937.

Presumably *Siyyid 'Alí-Muhammad dit le Báb*, quoted on numerous occasions in *The Dawn-Breakers*.

Literally, "the land of the Franks:" i.e. in general Europe and the West.

Identified in H. M. Hasan Balyuzi's *Edward Granville Browne and the Bahá'í Faith*, p. 11, as Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alí: "In Isfahán Browne met for an hour or two one of the most remarkable Bahá'ís of all times, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alí, who had known nine years of banishment in Khartoum, first in chains and close confinement and later in relative freedom (during the governorship of Ismá'íl Páshá Ayyúb), until released by the arrival of General Gordon in 1877."

Described in the Tablet itself as the son of the late Ághá Husayn Páshá.

See The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Note 23 on Paragraph 15, pp. 174-5.

Assuredly Mírzá Muhammad-'Alí, the Greater Branch, whose calligraphic skill is celebrated to this day.

The signification, as noted, of "Mishkín-Qalam."

Reminiscent of the following incident related by the same author in his introduction to *A Traveller's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb*: "Besides these a very old man with light blue eyes and white beard, whose green turban proclaimed him a descendant of the Prophet, advanced to welcome me, saying, 'We know not how we should greet thee, whether we should salute thee with "*as-selámu 'aleykum*" or with "*Alláhu abhá*."'"---pp. xxxvii-xxxviii

"God keep thee!"

The only children of Mishkín-Qalam mentioned in the present work are a daughter and a son: Sháh Begum and Mírzá 'Alí-Akbar.*

The scene is reminiscent of the circumstances in which, in Jacques-Henri Bernadin de Saint-Pierre's novel *Paul et Virginie*, the author, during a visit to Mauritius, hears from an old islander the tale of two families who had created for themselves there a little Utopia, before their idyllic existence was curtailed by tragedy. "'My son,' replied the old man, 'those heaps of rubbish, and that unfilled land, were, twenty years ago, the property of two families, who then found happiness in this solitude. Their history is affecting; but what European, pursuing his way to the Indies, will pause one moment to interest himself in the fate of a few obscure individuals?...' The old man, after a short silence, during which he leaned his face upon his hands, as if he were trying to recall the images of the past, thus began his narration:--- ..."

See the end of Section Three above.

This is the only reference in the volume to the King and the Beloved of Martyrs having been "Hájís:" perhaps the young vendor intends by the term that they had been on a visit to Bahá'u'lláh.*

The sum in question seems in fact to have been around eighteen thousand túmáns.*

This matter is mistaken, for the one that was indebted to those two brothers was the Imám-Jum'ih of Isfahán, Shaykh Báqir; however, we have here simply set forth the text of the English original. (Ishráq-Khávarí)*

Not just of Isfahán, but of the whole of Írán: "According to Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl (manuscript, p. 66), ... 'The office of Sadru's-Sudúr, or chief priest of Safaví times, was abolished by Nádir Sháh, and the Imam-Jum'ih of Isfahán is now the principal ecclesiastical dignitary of Persia.' (C. R. Markham's 'A General Sketch of the History of Persia,' p. 365.)"---*The Dawn-Breakers,* Footnote 3, p. 199

It appears that the original fatvá was issued by Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir and Mír Muhammad-Husayn, but then ratified by a larger assemblage of divines convened in the prince's presence on the seventh day. The number of divines in attendance on this latter occasion is set by Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl at around sixty.*

Among them, according to Áqá Husayn-'Alí Núr, as cited in the aforesaid *Khátirát-i-Muhájirí az Isfahán*, a telegram despatched by a servant of the Twin Shining Lights, one Mashhadí Haydar, a resident of their personal village of Áb-i-Níl (signifying "Water of the Nile"), who, on learning of their arrest, and finding the Bahá'ís debarred from sending telegrams, journeyed expeditiously to Káshán, from whence, with the help of the local friends, he telegraphed to the Sháh news of the proceeding (p. 18 ff).

Browne writes in the margin, "So far as is known, the Sháh's telegram reached Zillu's-Sultán *before* the death of the two brothers, but he kept the matter quiet; then after they had been put to death telegraphed to the Sháh saying that the royal decree had arrived too late -- after the deed had already been done -- and expressing profound regret at the circumstance." (Ishráq-Khávarí)

The place in question is understood from preceding accounts, as that of Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl, to have been a ruined wall or arch, situated in a waste place near the Níyásarm river. Áqá Husayn-'Alí Núr, however, is quoted in the aforesaid work as saying that the ruined place lay "behind the kitchen" (presumably of the Naqsh-i-Jihán Gardens palace complex), and that the reason why it was possible to extricate the bodies was because the collapsed wall had *fallen onto another wall*, so preserving the bodies that lay beneath (p. 37).*

According to previous accounts -- that of the author in Section Three above, and those of Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl and Fádil-i-Mázindarání in the present section -- this office was performed by Áqá Mírzá Ismá'íl, assisted by a number of his servants, and seemingly by Áqá Muhammad-Báqir-i-Mudarris too.*

The young vendor might be thought of as gesturing towards the river at this point.

"The body of Paul was placed by the side of his Virginia, at the foot of the same shrubs; and on that hallowed spot the remains of their tender mothers, and their faithful servants, are laid. No marble covers the turf, no inscription records their virtues; but their memory is engraven upon our hearts, in characters, which are indelible; and surely, if those pure spirits still take an interest in what passes upon earth, they love to wander beneath the roofs of these dwellings, which are inhabited by industrious virtue, to console the poor who complain of their destiny, to cherish in the hearts of lovers the sacred flame of fidelity, to inspire a taste for the blessing of nature, the love of labour, and the dread of riches."--- *Paul et Virginie*

"'The loved ones of God and His kindred,' is Bahá'u'lláh's testimony in the Súriy-i-Ra'ís, 'were left on the first night without food... The people surrounded the house \sc. of 'Izzat Áqá in Adrianople\, and Muslims and Christians wept over Us... We perceived that the weeping of the people of the Son (Christians) exceeded the weeping of others -- a sign for such as ponder.'"---*God Passes By*, pp. 179-80

"God hath, likewise, as a bounty from His presence, abolished the concept of 'uncleanness', whereby divers things and peoples have been held to be impure. He, of a certainty, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Verily, all created things were immersed in the sea of purification when, on that first day of Ridván, We shed upon the whole of creation the splendours of Our most excellent Names and Our most exalted Attributes. This, verily, is a token of My loving providence, which hath encompassed all the worlds. ..."---The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Paragraph 75

In fact, Bahá'ís are enjoined to love all men equally, irrespective of race, class, nation, creed or sex.

"The passion of Jesus Christ, and indeed His whole public ministry, alone offer a parallel to the Mission and death of the Báb, a parallel which no student of comparative religion can fail to perceive or ignore."---*God Passes By*, p. 56
