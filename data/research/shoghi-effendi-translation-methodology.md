# Shoghi Effendi's Translation Methodology — Research Bibliography

A comprehensive collection of sources on Shoghi Effendi's approach to translation:
his principles, style, terminology, and the institutional framework that treats his
translations as the standard for all subsequent work.

Compiled for the CTAI (Committee Translation AI) project.

## I. Primary Sources

### 1. Shoghi Effendi — Foreword to the *Kitab-i-Iqan*

The foundational statement of his translation philosophy:

> "This is one more attempt to introduce to the West, in language however inadequate,
> this book of unsurpassed pre-eminence among the writings of the Author of the
> Baha'i Revelation. The hope is that it may **assist others in their efforts to
> approach what must always be regarded as the unattainable goal — a befitting
> rendering of Baha'u'llah's matchless utterance.**"

- Baha'i Library mirror: https://mail.bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/iqan/iq-fwrd.htm
- PDF edition: https://www.datocms-assets.com/42576/1709204586-the-kitab-i-iqan-baha-u-llah.pdf

**Relevance to CTAI:** This passage establishes that even the authorized translator
regarded perfect rendering as impossible — the goal is to *approach* it. CTAI's
multi-agent deliberation is designed to systematically approach that unattainable
goal by surfacing every available precedent and perspective.

### 2. Ruhiyyih Khanum — *The Priceless Pearl*

The primary biographical source, with eyewitness accounts of his translation process.

Key insights:
- He was "meticulous in translating and made absolutely sure that the words he was
  using in English conveyed and did not depart from the original thought"
- He believed "Arabic synonyms usually meant the same thing but English ones always
  had a slight shade of difference which made it possible to be more exact in
  rendering the thought"
- He would take words with Romance/Latin roots and words with Germanic roots, find
  the synonyms, and note the distinctions
- He wrote everything aloud and changed sentences if necessary
- His translation of *The Dawn-Breakers* was described as a "re-creation" comparable
  to FitzGerald's rendering of Omar Khayyam

  basis** for other languages
- "Translations into European languages should be made on the basis of this English
  translation"
- Translators must "follow the example set by Shoghi Effendi in his magnificent
  translations"
- "A translation should be as true as possible to the original while being in the
  best possible style of the language into which it is being translated"
- Original texts use "very exalted and poetic Persian and Arabic," so translations
  should attempt "a similar flavour"
- "You cannot change and leave out words in the original and just put what you think
  it means in English"

### 10. Editorial Note — *Tablets of Baha'u'llah*

Explicitly states: "wherever possible, translations made by Shoghi Effendi have
been used," and that his renderings of quotations were adopted and adjusted to
original Tablets — underscoring their precedent value.

- https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/bahaullah/tablets-bahaullah/8

### 11. The Kitab-i-Aqdas Translation (Universal House of Justice)

Since Shoghi Effendi translated one third of the Kitab-i-Aqdas before his death,
the UHJ completed the translation striving for "accuracy of meaning, beauty of
English, and conformity of style with that used by Shoghi Effendi." This codifies
his **three core translation principles** as understood by the institutions.

## IV. Academic Papers and Articles

### 17. Perdu & Velasco — "Shoghi Effendi: An Approach to His Artistic Contribution to Style in English Literature and to Standards in Translation"

**The richest source of concrete, citable examples and term-by-term comparisons.**

Contains:
- Quantitative lexical analysis of his translations vs his own English writings
- Detailed worked examples from the *Kitab-i-Iqan* and *Kitab-i-Aqdas*
  (e.g., "veils of glory" vs "vain imaginings"; "World Order" / "System" for
  *nazm* and *tartib*)
- Discussion of his style as precedent and model for later translators
- Notes they used CTA ("a basic concordance programme and translation tool") for
  their lexical comparisons

Key finding: His translations represent "a grand synthesis of what might be called
English majestic writing, a careful and painstaking selection of the lexical
elements of the English literary tradition." No single model is followed; each is
"tempered by the introduction of seemingly foreign elements...blended seamlessly
into a new literary creation spanning and harmonising the full classical tradition
of English literature, including the best of Jacobean, Restoration, Victorian, and
Edwardian English."

### 18. Franklin Lewis — "Translating the Hidden Words" (1996)

Extended scholarly review by the University of Chicago professor of Persian literature.
Key insights:

- Shoghi Effendi's approach was "artistic rather than strictly doctrinal"
- His aim was "less to fix a particular meaning...than to provide a devotional text
  that would recreate the psychological and spiritual experience"
- The KJV style was chosen partly because English Baha'is of that era were
  church-educated and recognized this register as scriptural language
- "Personal inclination, therefore, in addition to any utilitarian aims, shaped or
  even determined the choice of language style"
- He revised the Hidden Words multiple times — 1924, 1925, 1929, and 1954 —
  consulting Esslemont and Ethel Rosenberg
- Musical analogy: meaning is like notes, style is tempo and tone. He "has not
  played a single wrong note" on meaning, while style choices remain independent
- He aimed for "elastic translation" prioritizing spiritual experience over
  doctrinal exactitude

### 19. Jack McLean — "The Art of Rhetoric in the Writings of Shoghi Effendi"

Identifies seven rhetorical modes: kerygmatic/proclamatory, imperative, magisterial,
defensive, praise/gratitude, rhetoric of blame, and anxious concern. Notes his
formal rhetoric training at the Syrian Protestant College (1915-17) and interest
in Oxford Union debates (1920-21).

matters, philosophy, and religious problems. Analyzes how the epistle differs from
ordinary correspondence in content and style.

### 21. Craig Volker — "Translating the Baha'i Writings" (1989-1990)

His style "reflects his love of the language of the King James Bible and his
conscious attempt to set a high cultural standard." The literary style was "the
result of an attempt to create a style that could act as a bridge between the
conventions of modern English and the rich and very figurative style of the originals."
Addresses the challenge that most translations into other languages are made from
his English rather than the original Arabic/Persian.

### 23. Bahiyyih Nakhjavani — "Style of the Language of Shoghi Effendi"

Conference talk notes with key insights:
- In great writing, content and style merge
- Use of "definitive negatives" as a stylistic device
- Deliberate use of circumlocutions to teach awe and reverence
- Careful, precise punctuation choices
- Verb tense gradually becoming more anticipatory
- "Chastity in style" as avoiding extremes
- "Impossible to eliminate any word from one of his sentences without sacrificing
  part of the meaning"

### 24. Muin Afnani — "General Introduction to English and Persian/Arabic Writings of Shoghi Effendi" (2005)

Approximately three-quarters of his writings were in English; most translations
occurred within the first 18 years of his Guardianship. Beyond literal translation,
he "interpreted and explained themes and concepts not understood properly by the
friends until that time."

- Irfan Colloquia: http://irfancolloquia.org/60/afnani_introduction/

### 25. Robert Stockman — "Terms Revelation, Interpretation, and Elucidation in the Baha'i Writings" (1996)

Includes the *Kitab-i-Iqan* Foreword line in full and comments on its implication
that translations are inherently limited ("unattainable goal") but his rendering
helps others approach it.

- Irfan Colloquia: https://irfancolloquia.org/4/stockman_terms/

### 26. "The Art of Translation" — Miller (Baha'i Library)

Includes and comments on the "unattainable goal" line. Discusses translation as
"a change of clothing" — transposing meaning across linguistic boundaries while
acknowledging inevitable loss. Emphasizes impression and emotional resonance
over literalism for sacred material.

- HTML: https://bahai-library.com/miller_art_translation

### 27. *Livius — Revista de Estudios de Traduccion* 5 (1994)

References the Foreword sentence as a classic example of a translator framing
his own work as provisional and exemplary — in a broader translation-studies context.

- PDF: https://hte.upf.edu/wp-content/uploads/Livius-5.pdf

### 28. "Translating the Baha'i Writings" — Academia.edu

Contemporary translation theory applied to Baha'i texts. Engages with institutional
guidance on following Shoghi Effendi's example; discusses his elevated register and
its function as a model.

## VI. Collaborative Process

### 31. George Townshend's Collaboration with Shoghi Effendi

Townshend assisted from 1926 until his death. He reviewed and edited translations of:
Hidden Words (1926-27), Kitab-i-Iqan (1930), The Dawn-Breakers (1930-31), Gleanings
(1934-35), Prayers and Meditations (1937), Epistle to the Son of the Wolf (1940),
and God Passes By (1944).

Shoghi Effendi recognized that "a literary expert like Mr Townshend, whose native
tongue was English, could assist him with advice on idiom and stylistic matters."
The changes were "slight and subtle, but the combination of all the fine-tuning
advice had the overall effect of elevating the translations from being very good
to being exquisite."

### 32. Interlinear Kitab-i-Iqan — Peter Schaida

Parallel presentation of Persian text alongside both Ali Kuli Khan's 1904 translation
and Shoghi Effendi's 1931 translation. Invaluable for directly comparing his
translation choices against the original and an earlier literal rendering.

## VII. CTA (Computer Translation Aid) — The Predecessor

### 33. CTA Project — About Page

Aims to make accessible "the precedents provided in Shoghi Effendi's translations"
and in World Centre-approved translations, for use as a terminology and style
reference in ongoing translation work. Perdu & Velasco describe it as "a basic
concordance programme and translation tool."

- https://ctaonline.org/pages/about-us

### 34. UHJ Letter — Interlinear Editions and CTA

Discusses CTA in context of maintaining consistency with established translations.
Response to why CTA wasn't freely available — suggestion was "noted" without
commitment to wider distribution.

### 35. Baha'i Library — CTA Tag Index

Aggregates items related to CTA, including references in articles on translation
tools and interlinear editions.

- https://bahai-library.com/tags/Computer_Translation_Aid_(CTA)

### 36. Sen McGlinn — "UHJ Elucidations" (blog)

Notes that Baha'i translators use CTA because "Bahai writings differ from those in
Persian and Arabic dictionaries," linking CTA with precedent-based terminology
choice drawn from Shoghi Effendi's translations.

## VIII. Popular Articles and Blog Posts

### 37. Layli Miron — "Why Do the English Translations Use Elevated Language?" (2020)

Three reasons for the elevated style:
1. **Fidelity** — The originals use formal, poetic Persian and Arabic
2. **Linguistic stability** — High literary style doesn't date as quickly
3. **Educational function** — Challenging vocabulary encourages contemplative reading

Craig Volker's comment distinguishes "elevated" from "archaic" — arguing contemporary
educated English can maintain dignity without antiquated constructions.

## X. Synthesized Principles

Based on all sources above, the core principles that inform CTAI:

1. **The Unattainable Goal** — Perfect rendering is impossible; the aim is to
   *approach* it through systematic effort
2. **King James Bible as stylistic model** — Elevated register conveying sacred
   character, not mere archaism
3. **Absolute fidelity to the original** — "You cannot change and leave out words"
4. **English synonym exploitation** — Using English's richer synonym differentiation
   to capture nuances Arabic/Persian synonyms don't distinguish
5. **Endurance over accessibility** — Language that lasts centuries
6. **Harmonic synthesis** — Blending Jacobean, Restoration, Victorian, and Edwardian
   English into a unique register
7. **Interpretive authority embedded in translation** — His translations sometimes
   clarify ambiguities in the originals
8. **Collaborative refinement** — Working with native English literary experts
   (Townshend, Rosenberg, Esslemont) to polish idiom
9. **Three core standards** (codified by UHJ): accuracy of meaning, beauty of English,
   conformity of style with his precedent
10. **Chastity of style** — Avoiding extremes, maintaining dignity and precision
11. **Writing aloud** — Testing every sentence aurally
12. **Webster's 1934 Dictionary** as primary reference tool
