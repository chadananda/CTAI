  "translation": "The Apostle of God - may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him - hath also said: \"He that looketh upon the sea at eventide, and saith: \\‘God is Most Great!' at sunset, God will forgive his sins, though they be heaped as piles of sand. And he that counteth forty waves, while repeating: \\‘God is Most Great!' - exalted be He - God will forgive his sins, both past and future.\"",
