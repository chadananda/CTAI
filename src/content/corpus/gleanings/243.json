  "translation": "Be fair in your judgment, O ye Ministers of State! What is it that We have committed that could justify Our banishment? What is the offense that hath warranted Our expulsion? It is We Who have sought you, and yet, behold how ye refused to receive Us! By God! This is a sore injustice that ye have perpetrated — an injustice with which no earthly injustice can measure. To this the Almighty is Himself a witness.…\nKnow ye that the world and its vanities and its embellishments shall pass away.",
