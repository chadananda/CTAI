##  Passages Translated by Shoghi Effendi
  

 Wherever possible, translations made by Shoghi Effendi have been used in preparing this book. In many instances his renderings of individual phrases have been incorporated, but these are too numerous to list. Below are listed two categories of translation that have been used. One is a direct translation of the actual Tablet concerned, or of excerpts therefrom. The second category is slightly less direct: in a number of His later Writings Bahá’u’lláh used to quote passages from His own Tablets, but when doing so He often modified the passage from which He was quoting. Thus, when Shoghi Effendi’s translations of such quoted passages—as, for example, in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf—have been used, they have had to be adjusted to agree with the passage as it appeared in the Tablet from which Bahá’u’lláh was quoting, as it is these original Tablets that are here translated. Such adjustments are slight and have not been specially noted, but will be apparent to anyone who compares the passages as they appear in this book with the volumes from which Shoghi Effendi’s translations are taken.
